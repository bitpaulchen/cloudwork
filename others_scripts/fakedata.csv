Santoli’s Wednesday market notes: Could September’s stock shakeout tee up#This is the daily notebook of Mike Santoli, CNBCs senior markets commentator, with ideas about trends, stocks and market statistics.
My take on the early Brexit winners and losers#"This commentary originally ran on Facebook. Boris Johnson – The former London mayor and grudging Leave supporter-turned enthusiastic Leave leader chose the winning side. Hes now a front-runner to lead the Tory party. ‪‎HellFreezesOver‬ Theresa May – Boris Johnsons populist approach to the Brexit campaign ticked off quite a few Tory elders, so the real money should be on UK Home Secretary Theresa May to succeed outgoing Prime Minister David Cameron. May is a political heavyweight and is generally respected among the Tories, something Boris Johnson is … um, not.  Nigel Farage – the once-embattled UK Independence Party leader gets his moment in the sun. Also gets to keep having a political career. And the fact that he quoted Independence Day in his victory speech made a crazy night that much crazier.  Marine Le Pen/Geert Wilders – Charismatic figures with a long history agitating for EU exits, Frances Marine Le Pen and the Netherlands Geert Wilders wasted no time calling for their own referendums. Brexit legitimizes their years of saber-rattling, and moves them from the political fringes into the mainstream, where they can do serious damage to the European project.  Vladimir Putin – Russias strongman needed this. Low oil prices have leveled the Russian economy, and the International Olympic Committee has banned Russian track athletes from competing at ‪‎Rio2016‬. But now he gets to say at least were not Europe.  Nicola Sturgeon – The head of the Scottish National Party delivered on her end from Scotland, where 62 percent of Scots voted to Remain, though turnout wasnt as high as hoped. She now has political leverage by threatening to hold another Scottish referendum. And if Scotland leaves, the British drought at Wimbledon gets retroactively reinstated.  German/US relations – Going to get stronger. By default.  David Cameron – The man called the referendum to keep Euroskeptic Tories from defecting to the UK Independence Party camp in last years parliamentary election. That turns out to have bought him an extra year in 10 Downing Street. Hope it was worth it, David. ‪‎KarmaIsABitch‬   British pollsters – whiffed on the Scottish referendum. Whiffed on last years parliamentary elections. Whiffed on the Brexit referendum. We were better off flipping a coin.   Alexis Tsipras – when the Greek Prime Minister held a referendum on whether the Greek people should sign a deal for more austerity, he just ignored the results. The fact that Cameron actually fell on his referendum sword makes Tsipras look silly. Oh, and Grexit is now a real possibility now that the precedent has been sent. Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn – Pundits have pointed to Labours particularly poor showing to get out the vote as a key reason why the Remain side failed to win. And Jeremy Corbyn just failed in his first real test as Labour leader. Labour has some soul-searching to do, though it feels like we say that after every election.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel – Brexit is now yet another problem for Europe (read: Merkel) to deal with. As if she didnt have enough to worry over.   The British pound sterling – As the pound fell to levels not seen since 1985, maybe the first time ever that the British wish they had adopted the euro.   Londons financial sector – Despite the UKs long-fraught relationship with the EU, it was clearly a net benefit for Londons financial sector, which could lay claim as the financial center of Europe. Much harder to do that when youve announced to the world you no longer want to be part of Europe. Look for Frankfurt to pick up the slack.   Donald J. Trump – Would have made him a winner, except he arrived in Scotland and announced that the Scottish took their country back. So many things factually incorrect in that one statement I dont even know where to begin. Still, Brexit shows that divisive politics has an audience, which could bode well for The Donald.

Europe&039;s recovery depends on Renzi&039;s Italy#In spring, ambitious reforms began in Italy. Under Matteo Renzi, the ailing economy will either begin a real recovery, or slide further. The outcome is vital to Italy, Europe and the global economy.   Soon the name of Matteo Renzi, the new prime minister of Italy, will be known better internationally, after his meetings with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Obama.    Along with French President François Hollande, the two know only too well whats at stake in Italys recovery. If it succeeds, the recovery of the euro zone will slowly continue. If not, the implications will be global. The reform drive of il Rottamatore   One year after being sworn in as Mayor of Florence in 2009, Matteo Renzi declared that a complete change was necessary in his Democratic Party and Italian politics. So he was nicknamed il Rottamatore (The Scrapper). Last February, the 39-year-old Renzi became the youngest person in history to be Italys Prime Minister — even younger than Mussolini.   (Read more: France to ply China with wine)   But can the Great Scrapper reverse Italys economic decline?   First, the good news: In the end of 2013, only two months before Renzi arrived in Rome, the longest recession in Italys postwar history ended.    The bad news is that, after nine consecutive quarters of negative growth, the economy is almost 10 percent smaller than before the crisis. Meanwhile, business continues to complain about the tax burden, and the unemployment rate has doubled to over 12 percent since 2007. Despite pledges of austerity in Brussels and Rome, Italys fiscal deficit is 3 percent of the GDP and its sovereign debt has climbed to more than 132 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP). Among the EU members, only Greece has more.    The only bright spot is the current account surplus, which is almost 1 percent of the GDP. The positive turn stems from a higher contribution from net exports, coupled with a decline in imports. Nonetheless, it will be hard for Italian exporters to sustain their performance in the near future.    The economy suffers from a de facto process of de-industrialization. Industrial production has not increased ever since August 2011 and is now down 25 percent from its peak. Credit contraction weighs heavily on business confidence and consumer sentiment.   Ambitious programs — on a monthly basis   Today, Renzis Democratic Party, Partito Democratico (PD), has its strongest constituencies in Northern-Central Italy and the big cities. PD runs 12 Italian regions out of a total of 20. It is social-democratic, progressive by outlook, reformist by inclination.    Renzi himself is perceived as a liberal modernizer. When he became prime minister, it was a sign of much-needed generational change in the aging Italy, in which potential growth amounts to barely 0.8  to 1 percent in the coming years.    (Read more: Russias next step: Capitol controls?)   Italy needs huge structural and institutional reforms. Renzi hopes to reverse the countrys longstanding decline by launching one large project every month, starting with a new electoral law to consolidate political decision-making, reforms in the public administration, and the tax system.    Even before Italys European Council presidency will begin on July 1, 2014, Renzi hopes to achieve on a monthly basis what Romes political class has failed to achieve in decades. After Berlusconis rule, he sees Italys political landscape as devastated. Even before his premiership, he suggested that Italys parliamentarians should vote for their own removal. To become prime minister, Renzi politically maneuvered his predecessor Enrico Letta to resign.    Nonetheless, Renzis program will initiate the long-needed transformation of Italy. If this program will fall apart, the failure could push the economy deeper into the abyss.   Slow recovery — or devastating depression   In the past, the euro zone avoided a major crisis as long as friction points were restricted to small economies (e.g., Greece, Portugal, Ireland), which each accounted for less than 3 percent of the euro zone GDP.    Everything changed in fall 2011 when the contagion effect reached Spain and Italy, which together account for almost 30 percent of the regional GDP. If, under these circumstances, Greece would have defaulted, it could have caused a contagion effect, particularly in Italy. That is why Greece has now received two bailouts (73 billion euros and 164 billion euros), is in talks about a third one (up to 20 billion euros) and more generous repayment terms.    As long as Greece remains solvent, Italy and Spain will have time to restore sustained growth.   (Read more: ECBs Weidmann says QE not out of the question)  The Italian economy remains vulnerable, however. Standard & Poors still has a negative outlook on the countrys BBB rating. Even by 2016, Italian economic output is likely to remain nearly 7 percent below 2007 levels. It is suffering from a lost decade.   The stakes are massive. Italy continues to account for 5 percent of gross commercial long-term debt globally, although its population is less than 1 percent of the world total.   While Brussels has demanded tough austerity programs, an exclusive focus on the latter would only make things worse in Italy. Instead, Renzis government is likely to reduce its huge debt only slowly, but focus on a lower deficit.    A failure to achieve progress would polarize Italy, destabilize Southern Europe and reduce global growth prospects.   How Italy goes, so will the world go.  — By Dan Steinbock  Dan Steinbock is research director of International Business at India China and America Institute (USA), visiting fellow at Shanghai Institutes for International Studies (China) and in the EU-Center (Singapore).

Specifically he discussed a proposed bill — a border-adjustment tax — that could hike rates on American imports. Despite concerns that a border tax could hurt oil prices, Chevrons Watson said industry imports would come into balance over time.

22. Hexadite#Founders: Eran Barak, Barak Klinghofer (chief product officer), Idan Levin (CTO) Launched: 2014 Headquarters: Boston Funding: $10.5 million   The three founders of Hexadite, a Boston-based cybersecurity firm, have backgrounds in investigating and mitigating attacks for military intelligence units and global defense companies. They knew that these same kinds of automated cyberattacks were plaguing a wide variety of companies, leaving them unprepared when responding to a breach or, worse, preventing a future attack.Hexadite uses artificial intelligence to investigate and remediate every alert a company receives, claiming it can resolve incidents in seconds, freeing up a companys response team to focus on threats that truly need their expertise. Hexadites Automated Incident Response Solution platform can integrate with customers existing security technologies and can cut response time by 95 percent, the company says.Co-founder and CEO Eran Barak spent five years in an elite intelligence unit of the Israel Defense Forces before starting Hexadite in 2014 and was also head of Elbit Systems cybertraining and simulation team. Late last year the company formed an alliance with other cybersecurity companies across the country, including Carbon Black, Check Point Software Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, to better integrate their products and automate important security processes.The goal of the alliance, explains Barak, is to utilize software to lighten the workload of security teams so that they can focus their time on the most dangerous and complex threats. The company has raised $10.5 million in funding from investors, including Hewlett Packard Ventures and TenEleven Ventures.

Guggenheim says solar sell-off is a buying opportunity and has#Renewable energy is poised to play an ever greater role as the world shifts away from fossil fuels, and the recent pullback in clean tech stocks presents a buying opportunity, Guggenheim said while initiating coverage on solar stocks.We believe that the shift to distributed energy generation and storage is a large, sustained phenomenon, and owning best-in-class companies makes sense, the firm wrote in a note to clients. We expect distributed solar installations to continue growing robustly, especially now that energy storage is becoming economically viable.Following a 140% gain in 2020, the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF has dipped 20% this year. The S&P 500, by comparison, has gained 12%.Guggenheim pointed to several possible factors driving the declines, including excessive valuations after 2020s record run, as well as slower-than-expected governmental policies. Other concerns include rising input costs, such as for steel and semiconductors, and higher interest rates.But given solars large and growing market, Guggenheim said the pullback is an attractive opportunity to pick up shares of quality names.
Eni Pays Dominion $4.76 Billion for U.S. Gulf Assets#Italian oil and gas company Eni has bought upstream assets in the Gulf of Mexico from Dominion Resources for $4.757 billion, Eni said in a statement on Monday.Eni said the acquisition would boost its production in the area to more than 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in the second half of 2007. In the period from 2007-2010, production from the new assets would average more than 75,000 boepd.Eni, Europes fourth-biggest oil company by market value, said included in the purchase were exploration assets for $680 million and said around 60% of he overall leases were operated.Through this transaction we reach the necessary critical mass for our activities in the Gulf of Mexico, Eni Chief Executive Officer Paolo Scaroni said in the statement.Eni is one of the few world oil majors which has been able to largely avoid a decline in output as it adds production both through acquisitions and as new fields come onstream.It has made several large acquisitions recently.Earlier this month it won with Italian utility Enel a $5.8 billion auction for assets formerly held by bankrupt oil firm YUKOS but they handed the bulk of the prize to Russian gas monopoly Gazprom.Eni agreed to buy a package of Congolese assets from Frances Maurel et Prom for $1.4 billion earlier this year and in March struck a deal to split a stake in one of those fields with Burren Energy.
Strategist Paulsen: Market bottom is not in#Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist of Wells Capital Management, believes the stock market sell-off is not over.  Finding a bottom in the stock market may well be a fools game,  but that does not stop us fools from trying, Paulsen wrote to clients Tuesday. He added: In our view, a quick  recovery back near all-time highs would leave the stock market  with many of the same vulnerabilities that started the  correction. Consequently, we would not be surprised if the stock  market tests its correction low yet again and perhaps even fails  before reaching a final bottom.  Here is why he believes the market is vulnerable…
CDC says 28 blood clot cases, 3 deaths may be#CDC scientists say their investigation into a rare blood clotting issue linked to the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine has identified 28 people who developed the potentially life threatening blockages — three of whom have died.The Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on April 13 asked states to temporarily halt using J&Js vaccine out of an abundance of caution while it investigated six women, ages 18 to 48, who developed cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, or CVST, in combination with low blood platelets within about two weeks of receiving the shot.They recommended resuming use of the shot 10 days later after the CDC determined that the benefits of the inoculations outweighed their risks.CVST is a form of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia, or TTS, which are blood clots with a low platelet count that puts patients at risk for a stroke.

Banks within Wal-Mart stores collecting high fees#Wal-Mart has a reputation for offering shoppers low  prices, but a report in The Wall Street Journal found  that the independent banks it houses inside its stores levy some  of the highest bank fees, largely as a result of overdraft charges.  After analyzing federal filings, the publication found that last  year, the five banks that have the largest presence in the  discounters stores were among the top 10 domestic banks in  terms of income from fees as a percentage of deposits.  Those banks are Fort Sill National Bank, First Convenience Bank,  Academy Bank, Woodforest National Bank and City National Bank and  Trust Company.  Overdraft fees can be a big issue for people struggling financially, as accruing them over time makes it makes it difficult to get out of debt.

Theres uncertainty around that and its going to continue for the next several months.

Financial planner: Heres when you should temporarily stop saving for#As the coronavirus spreads across the United States, American life has come to a halt: schools are closing, sports leagues are suspended, events are canceled and officials from major cities are announcing restrictions on restaurants and bars.Some Americans are already out of work and millions could end up losing their jobs in a potential recession.While financial advisors typically encourage setting aside at least a small portion of your income for the future, ideally 10-15%, now may be the time to scale back or stop contributing to retirement-specific accounts if you dont have cash savings to fall back on. If you dont have three to six months worth of expenses saved in an emergency fund, temporarily stop contributing to retirement accounts, Nick Holeman, certified financial planner at Betterment, tells CNBC Make It. Take the money youd normally save for retirement and put it into an account for emergencies. Pausing retirement contributions is not ideal, he emphasizes, but this will be a short-term change. Commit to start contributing again once you are back on your feet.
Instead of shunning Saudi Arabia after Khashoggi killing, investors flock#Saudi Arabia raised $7.5 billion in its first dollar bond sale since the killing of Saudi dissident and U.S. resident Jamal Khashoggi incited an international uproar.Khashoggis killing sparked concerns that international investors would shun the kingdom. Saudi Arabia is prosecuting several agents and officials allegedly involved in the slaying at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.Riyadh denies that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was involved in the murder, but the CIA has reportedly concluded that the king-in-waiting was complicit in the killing.While some business executives have cut ties with the kingdom over the incident, bond buyers do not appear ready to overlook an investment opportunity in Saudi Arabia, the worlds largest oil exporter.The issuance was nearly four times oversubscribed, with the order book peaking at $27.5 billion, according to the Saudi Ministry of Finance.Saudi Arabia sold $4 billion in 10-year notes that mature in 2029, and $3.5 billion in in 31-year notes that come due in 2050.U.S.-based investors accounted for 40 percent of the 2029 bond purchases and 45 percent of the 2050 debt, according to Reuters.On Wednesday, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said state-owned oil giant Aramco will issue bonds in the second quarter of this year. The debt will most likely be issued in dollars, he said.WATCH: Turkish foreign minister says Saudis have heard Khashoggi killing audio
Bryce Harpers $330 million Phillies contract cant solve baseballs bigger#Major League Baseball spring training is underway and some of the biggest concerns about spending by teams headed into the MLB season have now been addressed, with roughly $1 billion spent on new player contracts within the last two weeks. On Thursday, all-star outfielder Bryce Harper signed a 13-year, $330 million contract with the Philadelphia Phillies, the largest contract in MLB history in total value, though not per-year salary. The week previous, the San Diego Padres doled out $300 million over 10 years to Manny Machado. The Colorado Rockies also resigned Nolan Arenado to an eight-year, $260 million contract; the New York Yankees gave outfielder Aaron Hicks a seven-year, $70 million deal; and the St. Louis Cardinals starter Miles Mikolas received four years and $68 million.But bigger problems persist for the MLB: Attendance is down, games are still too long, and the gap between the richest and poorest teams remains wide, leading to a lack of competitiveness from many teams .Eight major league teams experienced double-digit attendance losses in 2018, led by the Miami Marlins 52 percent decline — the laggard was no surprise, as the Marlins traded both 2017 National League Most Valuable Player Giancarlo Stanton to the New York Yankees and Christian Yelich to the Milwaukee Brewers (who went on to win the 2018 National League MVP award) before the season began, as part of the beginning of a long rebuilding process.Several currently successful teams embraced a rebuilding process, such as the 2017 World Series champion Houston Astros and 2016 World Series champion Chicago Cubs. The Padres will be another test case this season: The team inked the Machado deal after amassing what is widely regarded as one of the best farm systems in baseball, but also after close to a decade of consistently poor results on the field — the team has not had a winning record since 2010 and has not made the playoffs since 2006.Like the Padres 66-96 record last season, there have been several other teams who have drowned in losses, mostly from stripping talent away, attempting to rebuild younger and cheaper rosters. The Baltimore Orioles went 47-115 last season; the Chicago White Sox and Cincinnati Reds have both had five or more straight losing seasons since 2014.
This is the most expensive country to send overseas workers#Japan has overtaken the U.K. as the most expensive place to send overseas employees to work, a new report has found.The average expatriate package in Japan costs employers $405,685 – more than any other international business hub, according to MyExpatriate Market Pay survey by data company ECA International.The study — which takes into account cash salaries, benefits and tax — points to an uptick in the overall cost of mid-level expat packages in Japan. It comes even as other parts of the world saw the price of accommodation and benefits take a hit due to the pandemic.The U.K. fell from the top spot to rank as the second most expensive location to send overseas employees in 2020. The others that ranked high on the overall cost list were India, China and Hong Kong.
Chinese Retail Sales Surge, Partly on Inflation#Chinas retail sales growth surged in August to its quickest pace in more than three years, beating forecasts, but analysts said the jump largely reflected stronger inflation, not necessarily quicker underlying growth. Retail sales, which are tracked in nominal terms, grew 17.1% from a year earlier, compared with 16.4% in July. The uptick roughly tracked a rise in annual consumer inflation in August to 6.5%, from 5.6% in July. Retail sales growth is obviously strong. The problem is that the figures are being pushed up by the rising inflation as well. So actually, on a real basis, I dont think theres much of an acceleration, said Paul Cavey, an economist with Macquarie Securities in Hong Kong. Augusts pace, the quickest since May 2004, beat economists expectations of a 16.5% rise. Consumer inflation data, released on Tuesday, also surprised on the upside. Beijing would welcome an increase in real buying activity by the countrys consumers. It is trying to tilt its economy away from what economists call an unsustainable reliance on exports -- to the tune of 40% of national output. Not only does Chinas gaping trade surplus -- it hit $25 billion in August -- contribute to tensions with its major trading partners, it also exposes it more to any downturn in the United States or other economies. Cavey said that a lynchpin of Beijings efforts to spur spending would be their effectiveness in the countryside, and that a recent epidemic among pigs was likely to blunt growth in spending there this year. We will expect retail sales growth to continue to be strong next year as the countryside gets over all this, he said. In the details, the retail sales data suggested a significant impact from the recent spike in food price inflation. Sales of grain and edible oils and meat, eggs and poultry, two of the categories where price rises have been most striking, rose 44% and 45.2%, respectively. Still, Lin Songli, senior economist at Guosen Securities in Beijing, said the figures showed that consumption was starting to take up a greater role in driving the worlds fastest-growing major economy. Consumption growth has not reached its peak yet, and we are now expecting even higher growth rates in coming months, Lin said.
Brussels attacks may sway Brexit vote: Strategists#European stocks, especially the transportation sector, were  declining, in the wake of Tuesdays terrorist attacks at the main  Brussels airport and a metro station near European Union  buildings.  Nandini Ramakrishnan, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset  Management, told CNBCs Worldwide Exchange the blasts were likely to dampen  a key driver of Europes recovery.  I think theres a larger story here, where these types of events  do affect consumer sentiment, Ramakrishnan said. Were worried  about consumer discretionary sectors, which have been really  pioneering the European recovery.  European airlines stocks fell after news of explosions. Air  France, for example, was down about 4 percent. Travel on small  commercial flights, which Europe is known for, is likely to  continue slowing as fears about terrorism reignite, Ramakrishnan  said.  [But] markets are a bit more resilient than we think, people are  still waiting to see as the news develops, she said. Its very  difficult for traders and investors to position themselves in any  way for something like this.  The attacks in Brussels could impact the so-called Brexit  referendum in June, said Ramakrishnan. An event like today  certainly does push the case for certain campaign language for  the U.K. to leave the EU a bit further.  Ramakrishnan sees shakiness in U.K. equities, because of investor  indecision on whether to put money into companies that rely on  the close relationship with the European Union.Were in a bit of a wait-and-see mode, she added. The  uncertainties could certainly affect markets in a negative way.
China to Rein in Bank Lending, Ballooning Surplus#China will take steps to contain a renewed burst in bank lending and a larger-than-expected rise in the countrys controversial trade surplus last month, senior officials said on Friday. Speaking on the sidelines of a annual parliamentary session, which ends on Friday, central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan said the authorities would place further controls on bank lending.From a commercial perspective, it is understandable for the banks to lend aggressively at the beginning of the year, Zhou told reporters. But from a macro perspective, after serious study, we decided to place further controls (on it), he said. He did not offer any timeframe. Lending data released this week reinforced concern that banks, awash with cash, may fund a new round of speculative investment. Lending surged by 413.8 billion yuan in February, compared with an increase of 149.1 billion yuan in February 2006. Separately, Commerce Minister Bo Xilai said the nations trade surplus had been too large in February and reaffirmed that Beijing planned new steps to trim exports and step up imports. China on Monday reported its second-biggest monthly trade surplus on record, dwarfing forecasts and handing fresh ammunition to critics who say Beijing is giving its exporters an unfair edge by holding down the yuan. The surplus for February ballooned to $23.76 billion, with exports leaping 51.7% from a year earlier. We are also very nervous about that, Bo said of the size of Februarys surplus. Were seriously studying the whole situation to find the underlying reasons. One reason for the surge was a propensity among Chinese firms to ship their goods out of the country to prevent them from being penalized by possible policy changes, he said. The Commerce ministry would make appropriate adjustments to the export tax rebate system, paying special attention to the area of processing trade as that generated the biggest portion of the surplus, Bo told reporters, without giving details. Zhou also said the authorities were keeping a wary eye on inflation, which he said had been running too high. Asked whether the central bank would raise interest rates soon, Zhou said they were seriously studying the inflation situation and would take appropriate measures.

Citigroup to Halve Investment Spending in 2007#Citigroup, the top U.S. bank by assets, expects its investment spending next year to be less than half the 2006 level, its chief executive said on Thursday, acknowledging that its consumer bank has yet to turn the corner. Speaking at the banks analyst day presentation, Charles Chuck Prince also said he shares investors frustration with the banks lackluster share performance, but encouraged shareholders to be patient. I feel very good about the changes were making ... but theres no short-cut to get from where we are to where were going, he said. Prince, under increasing pressure from investors, on Monday named a new chief operating officer at the bank and promised an increased focus on costs. During Thursdays presentation, Prince discussed ways Citigroup aims to increase revenue, including expanding its financial advisory business and increasing its private banking efforts. Increased revenue and lower investment spending should help Citigroups revenue grow faster than expenses next year, and profits grow faster than revenue, Prince said. That positive operating leverage would reverse a trend this year of operating expense growth outpacing revenue growth. Citigroups relatively weak earnings growth has weighed on its shares, which are up 8.7% so far this year, lagging an 11.6% gain in the KBW Bank index for the same period. Investors gave a moderate vote of confidence to Princes latest prescriptions for the banks ills, boosting Citigroup shares by 0.8% and making them one of the sessions top gainers in the sector index. That (cut in 2007 investment spending) is giving investors confidence thatthere may be operating leverage in 2007 after not seeing a lot of operating leverage in the last couple of years, said Sam Rahman, portfolio manager at Baring Asset Management Inc. in Boston, which owns Citigroup shares. I think thats what investors are keying off on.Overseas GrowthOthers remained skeptical. Its more of the same, said William Smith, chief executive of SAMAdvisors, LLC, which owns Citigroup stock. In our opinion, its disturbing that he (Prince) does not understand whats going on. He is losing the battle here as far as what shareholders want. Smith said Citigroup shares had been bolstered last week by talk that the bank could replace Chief Financial Officer Sallie Krawcheck or even Prince, or could spin off some units. Prince said revenue growth in the U.S. consumer bank was taking longer than he had expected, but he was cautiously optimistic about it improving. The company is taking steps like combining its brokerage and bank franchises, in an effort to offer more products to customers. Prince said the company was unlikely to make any large U.S. bank acquisitions in 2007, reiterating that there were better opportunities to buy businesses overseas. Citigroup on Wednesday agreed to acquire Central American commercial and retail bank Grupo Cuscatlan for $1.51 billion and last month led a team of investors that won control of Chinas Guangdong Development Bank with a bid of 24.3 billion yuan ($3.1 billion). Citigroup is budgeting for moderate deterioration in credit quality for 2007, Prince said. Prince, who met with analysts alongside chief-operating-officer-to-be Robert Druskin, Krawcheck and other executives, also said Citigroup could boost credit loss reserves in Japan due to legislative changes.
Euro zone to launch bailout fund with Spain in focus#By Jan Strupczewski   BRUSSELS, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers willlaunch their 500 billion euro ($653.00 billion) permanentbailout fund on Monday, putting in place a major defence againstthe debt crisis that now threatens Spain.   The fund, called the European Stability Mechanism (ESM),will be used to lend to distressed euro zone sovereigns inreturn for strict fiscal and structural reforms that aim to puteconomies that have lost investor trust back on track.   It is part of the single currency areas drive for anoverhaul of its economic structures and deeper integration, adiscussion that will be taken forward on Monday with talks on anidea to create a single euro-zone budget.   Euro zone finance ministers, who form the ESMs board ofgovernors, will hold their inaugural meeting in Luxembourg twoyears after EU leaders endorsed the idea of setting up such apermanent institution.   The ESM will be operational as of Monday, said a euro zoneofficial, linked to the ESM.   The funds lending capacity will be based on 80 billioneuros of paid-in capital and 620 billion of callable capital,against which the ESM will borrow money on the market to lend iton to governments cut off from sustainable market funding.   It will reach its full capacity gradually by 2014.   Its first task will be to lend to Spain for therecapitalisation of its banking sector, hit hard by a collapseof the real estate market - a programme inherited from thetemporary European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).   Madrid is likely to ask for about 40 billion euros torecapitalise its banks following independent assessments of thesectors needs -- well within the 100 billion euros set aside byeuro zone finance ministers for the purpose in July.   The ESM money would flow to Spain in November, afterEuropean Commission competition authorities approve conditionsfor the recapitalisation for each bank.   SPAIN IN FOCUS   Spain is in investors focus because it has struggled to cutone of the euro zones largest public deficits as the countrysinks deeper into its second recession in three years.   In Luxembourg, euro zone ministers will also discuss arequest, expected from Spain sometime in the coming weeks, for aprecautionary credit line from the ESM that they hope will boostinvestor confidence and keep Madrid in the capital markets.   A euro zone source said they may also discuss Spains tough2013 budget, outlined last month, which the InternationalMonetary Fund and the European Commission both believe is basedon an over-optimistic forecast of a 0.5 percent economiccontraction next year. The current IMF forecast of a 1.2 percentrecession may be revised further downwards on Tuesday.   A revised budget based on updated IMF and EU forecasts maybe one condition for assistance from the ESM.   Such a programme would likely entail the issuance offirst-loss guarantees on bonds sold by Spain at auction, or somesimilar form of rescue to bolster Madrids credibility.   Guaranteeing the first 20-30 percent loss on new Spanishbonds would allow - through leveraging - all of Spains 207billion debt issuance in 2013 to be made much more attractive toinvestors using roughly 50 billion euros of euro zone money.   Such an amount would fit comfortably within the 100 billionlimit already approved by parliaments for the bank rescue incountries with strong anti-bailout sentiment like Germany andFinland, making it politically more palatable, even iftechnically it would remain a separate operation.   A credit line for Spain would also open the way forpurchases of Spanish bonds on the secondary market by theEuropean Central Bank -- a prospect that has lowered Spanishyields already from above 7 percent in July to below 5.72 now.   But Germany opposes a Spanish bailout request now, becauseit would prefer to bundle Spain with a request for a small, 15billion euro bailout for Cyprus and a revision of the second,130 billion euro bailout for Greece in one crisis-solvingpackage later this year.   This would allow German Chancellor Angela Merkel, wary ofshaky support for bailouts in her own ruling coalition, to pushthe large crisis package through parliament in one go, ratherthan fight separate battles for each.   As a result, a Spanish request is unlikely for a few weeks.   The ministers will also take stock of the efforts of Greeceto unblock payments from the second bailout agreed in Februaryafter reforms in the debt-laden country stalled because of twogeneral elections in May and June.   Inspectors representing international lenders are in talkswith the Greek government on reforms and austerity needed tounlock financial aid, but their full report is unlikely beforethe end of October.   EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn saidon Saturday he expected Greeces government to agree on neededsavings in the coming days since the lengthy talks between thetroubled euro country and lenders had advanced.($1 = 0.7657 euros)(Additional reporting by Julien Toyer in Madrid; Editing byPaul Taylor)((jan.strupczewski@thomsonreuters.com)(+32 2 287 68 37)(ReutersMessaging: jan.strupczewski.reuters.com@reuters.net))Keywords: EUROGROUP/
Absolut Breakthrough: CBS Allows Spirits Ad During Grammys#Those tuning into the Grammys may have caught a glimpse of a television milestone, and it didn’t happen on stage at the music awards show.Absolut vodka debuted a new ad, marking the first time a spirits brand aired a commercial during the Grammys. More importantly, it was also a first for spirits advertising in prime time in several CBS markets. The ad, which ran in 15 of the largest media markets on many CBS-owned-and-operated stations, is a breakthrough for the spirits industry, which has been rebuffed in its attempts to buy airtime on the major networks in the past. No doubt, the proliferation of advertisements on cable stations and local network affiliates has laid the groundwork for this event. “We’re not surprised, it’s been a steady progression,” said Frank Coleman, a spokesman for the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, an industry trade group. Coleman said the television advertising of spirits brands has built steadily over the past decade, although it has leveled off more recently as companies have spent more of their ad budget online. Absolut, a Swedish vodka brand that was purchased by Pernod Ricard last year, has long been known for its memorable advertising. “I think we continue to take an innovative approach to media and advertising,” said Ian Crystal, brand director of Absolut Vodka at Pernod Ricard USA. According to Crystal, there wasn’t any resistance at CBS and its affiliates. He attributes this to the “iconic” nature of the Absolut brand. For the first 25 years, the brand’s image was built around print advertising that centered on the distinctive shape of its bottle. But the campaign shifted in May 2007, with the launch of the “In An Absolut World” campaign. Now about 30 percent to 40 percent of the brand’s ad budget is spent on television and film advertising. According to Crystal, the campaign’s concept is about ideas, which translate well on film, and therefore lends itself to television advertising. The latest incarnation of the campaign is the “Hugs” spot, which depicts scenes from an idealized world. As the music of Louis Armstrong plays, people from around the world exchange hugs and other signs of affection rather than currency. The 30-second spot, created by ad agency TBWAChiatDay, will continue to air on broadcast and cable in seven key markets over the next week. Events like the Grammys are often used by advertisers as a way of reaching a mass audience joined by a common interest. Music is a leading interest among adults 21 years to 24 years old, who are Absolut’s key demographic. Last year, the Grammy Awards reached an estimated 17 million viewers. Ratings for Sunday’s show were not immediately available. More from Consumer Nation:Questions? Comments? Email us at consumernation@cnbc.com
The Hail Mary to Sen. Mary Landrieu on Keystone vote#After six years of discussion, the Keystone pipeline is finally  going to get an up or down vote on the U.S. Senate floor,  confirming the adage, elections have consequences. What led to  this change? Politics.  On Wednesday, Sen. Mary Landrieu, the embattled  Democrat, facing a Dec. 6 runoff, called on the Senate to  put the Keystone pipeline issue up for a vote. She was pushing  for this to be the first order of business in the lame-duck  session of Congress.  In quick turn, the Democratic leadership blessed the gambit, in  what political reporters on Capitol Hill are calling the Hail  Mary to save Landrieus Senate seat. The idea is to get her name  on the bill that approves the pipeline, which is very popular in  her home state of Louisiana, where she is behind in in the polls. Late Wednesday the Republican leadership announced they had a  deal with Democrats for a vote as early as Tuesday. How did the  decisions to vote next week happen? Politics.    When House leadership got wind of the Hail Mary, they quickly  crafted a Keystone pipeline bill to hit the House floor this  week. The author of the bill is listed as Rep. Bill Cassidy, the  Republican congressman from Louisiana and the candidate facing  Landrieu in the Dec. 6 runoff election for the Senate  seat. Read MoreEconomics no longer makes Keystone  pipeline viable  The political calculus goes something like this: Passing the  Cassidy bill on the House floor this week will give him top  billing in the news cycles through the weekend and the final bill  will likely bear both of their names. In addition to the timing  issues, the bill will need 60 votes to overcome procedural  hurdles. Until now the best Keystone had done was 54 votes. This  means passage will require six Democrats to flip their votes,  something the Republican supporters of Cassidy look forward to  pointing out to anyone who will listen.

No More Retail Nirvana: Hedge Fund Manager#No more retail nirvana, David Berman, founder of Durban Capital, which manages over 100 million in assets told CNBC today.Berman has focused solely on retail for some time. This past spring he changed his opinion and downgraded the retail sector for several reasons. First, WalMart is back to being Walmart, the hedge fund manager said. The company represents 23 percent of all sales from publicly traded retail companies. With this enormous stronghold, this is not good for the supermarket chains or for discounters now that WalMart is back to being more price competitive, he said. Take J.C. Penney and Kohl’s for example, they may get hurt because Walmart does have some apparel.Second, if you look at the math in the retail sector in general—home improvement, discounters, apparel retailers, supermarkets, and department stores—this sector could turn negative come September, Berman said, adding, people are worried about. 
OPEC comments show lost relevance ahead of meeting#Comments from Saudi Arabian officials stirred speculation OPEC could be considering abandoning its market-based  pricing strategy, but the cartel is unlikely to change policy  and it heads into next weeks meeting less relevant than ever.  Oil surged Monday on remarks from Saudi officials that the  country is willing to work with oil producing and exporting  countries, both inside and outside of OPEC to maintain market and  price stability. West Texas Intermediate crude futures shot higher after the comments but then fell back and fluctuated.Its really just short covering. The Saudi comments are a  reminder to the market that the Saudis arent powerless, but OPEC  is overall for sure. At some point, the sell-off will be  vulnerable to a production response. The fact of the matter is if  they really do cut production by a million or 2 million barrels,  the market would react to that. I dont think theyre ready to do  that yet, said oil analyst John Kilduff of Again Capital.

Judge sends Benchmark’s lawsuit against Travis Kalanick to arbitration#A judge has granted former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick a legal win on Wednesday by sending an explosive lawsuit brought by his investors to arbitration rather than ordering it to play out in his courtroom.The decision is the latest dramatic turn in an rift between Uber and once of his closest allies, Benchmark Capital, and moves the ugly fight between them out of the spotlight as Ubers new CEO tries to assert control.Mr. Kalanick is pleased that the court has ruled in his favor today and remains confident that he will prevail in the arbitration process, a Kalanick spokesperson said.

What’s the Risk for Investors of Turkey Going Islamist ?#Turkey is as complex as a Byzantine mosaic or a potent Turkish coffee.

EU, Iran to Impact Crude Oil Prices, Experts Say#Crude oil prices in the short-term future will likely hinge on several factors, including the European debt crisis and the situation in Iran, traders said Friday on “Fast Money.” Crude soared to $103 a barrel earlier this week and dropped to $98 in midday trading. “We haven’t been talking about Iran when oil is concerned so that’s always the headline risk,” trader Steve Grasso said. “I would expect it to sell off a bit and then rally a bit over the next couple of weeks back toward that $100 mark.”
Buy Apple—the bulls will win this ‘war’: Trader#After three tough months for Apple, the tech giant is finally finding a bottom,  according to one trader.   Apple shares are down more than 20 percent since November due to concerns about slowing iPhone sales and a  difficult economic environment in China. But that selling makes  this the ideal time to make a bullish play on the stock,  according to Andrew Keene of AlphaShark.  Keene believes that new products will give Apple a much-needed  boost. Keene also noted that the company is still holding plenty  of cash.  In the short term, we might get some volatility, ... [but] it is  starting to consolidate here, Keene said Thursday on CNBCs  Trading Nation.  This is a tug of war between the bulls and the bears to see who  wins.  And Keene says the bulls now have the edge.Read More  Why traders are betting on a big bounce for the metals  By 2017, I think Apple can march its way back to up to the  highs, just like Facebook did, up to that $115 level, he  said.   To make a bullish trade, Keene is buying the January 2017  105-strike call and selling the January 115-strike call for a  total cost of $2.50 per share, which is an options strategy known  as a bull call spread. Keene sees maximum profits if Apple  rises to $115 by January expiration, but the trade is profitable  if Apple shares rise to $107.50 by that time. Below that level,  his losses are capped at the amount spent on the trade.  A jump to $107.50 would be a 12 percent move for Apples stock,  which traded around $96 on Friday morning.
How teen created a profitable sneaker pawn shop#Like many 16-year-olds, Chase Reed spends his days tied to his  iPhone and Instagram account.   But you wont catch his dad, Troy Reed, bugging him to get off  social media anytime soon. Thats because with each like the  teenager acquires online, the father and son are seeing big  dollars.The father and son have opened a pawnshop exclusively  devoted to sneakers. Sneaker Pawn USA is based in an apartment in New Yorks Harlem where the two used to live and have converted into sneaker start-up central.

Chase works along side his father to buy, trade and  sell Air Jordans and other brands in the store, which opened in  June.Troy says his son—still in high school—runs the  show. I actually work for him, and its probably the best  job Ive ever had, said Troy, himself a serial entrepreneur. His  past ventures included barber shop. He now works full-time  at the sneaker pawn shop.
Conditions on Disabled Cruise Ship in Dispute#A cruise line said it is making the passengers stranded aboard a  disabled ship in the Gulf of Mexico as comfortable as possible  with running water and some working bathrooms, contradicting the  accounts of some passengers who told relatives of filthy, hot  conditions and limited access to food.  The ship, the Carnival Triumph, is still at least a day from  being guided to a port in Mobile, Ala. Carnival President Gerry Cahill said  Tuesday the ship has running water and most of its 23 public  restrooms and some of the guest cabin bathrooms were working. He  downplayed the possibility of an outbreak of disease from  unsanitary conditions, saying the ship had not seen an abnormal  number of people reporting to the infirmary as being ill.  No one here from Carnival is happy about the conditions onboard  the ship, Cahill said at a news conference in Miami. We  obviously are very, very sorry about what is taking place.  (Read More: Sick Guests, Dirty Boat:  Inside Stranded Carnival Ship)  Jimmy Mowlam, 63, whose 37-year-old son, Rob Mowlam, got married  Saturday onboard the ship, said his son told him by phone Monday  night that there is no running water and few working toilets. He  said passengers were given plastic bags to use for their  business.  Despite a forecast of brisker winds and slightly higher seas, the  Coast Guard and Carnival said they did not expect conditions to  deteriorate aboard ship.  A cold front was expected to cross the central Gulf where the  vessel is under tow, bringing north and northwesterly winds of 15  to 25 mph and seas of 4 to 6 feet, said Dennis Feltgen, spokesman  for the National Hurricane Center.  However, such conditions shouldnt affect conditions aboard ship,  said Bill Segelken, spokesman for the Coast Guard Galveston  command center.  The ship was about 200 miles south of Mobile, Ala., as Tuesday  faded into Wednesday, the Coast Guard said. Carnival says the  ship is expected to arrive in Mobile on Thursday.
Starting a Business: The Romance vs. the Reality#Some people who toil discontentedly in corporate cubicles regard entrepreneurship as the cure for all workplace ills. Only when they’ve experienced running a business personally do they find that the reality is much different.Mike Cleary, for example, left his job as a sales and marketing executive to become an entrepreneur because he was tired of office politics. But after buying a franchise and an existing business about eight years ago, Cleary sparred with difficult vendors and suppliers. “It seemed very one-sided, with many commitments and obligations on my part, and much less required of the people I was buying from,” he said.In an effort to establish trust, he says, he extended credit to a client of the previous owner. Unfortunately, he says, the client was not forthcoming with payment, costing him tens of thousands of dollars in lost revenue.
Kendall Jenner just bought an $8.55 million house in Beverly#While her sisters Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner are building business empires around digital media and cosmetics, 21-year-old Kendall Jenner is raking in a fortune of her own.

Jenner paid $8.55 million for a Spanish-style Beverly Hills, Calif., mansion, according to Trulia. The house at one point belonged to Charlie Sheen. The pictures below are the same used when Sheen listed and sold the house in 2016 for $5.4 million.Take a look inside.
VMware CEO Pat Gelsinger says a Dell spinoff could give#VMware CEO Pat Gelsinger said that if majority owner Dell follows through with a spinoff of his company, it would provide him with greater flexibility to team up with other hardware makers.Speaking to CNBC ahead of this weeks virtual VMworld conference, Gelsinger said VMwares server virtualization software could start to show up with HP if thats what customers want.The ecosystem would look favorably on a more independent VMware, Gelsinger said. VMware shares have dropped this year, underperforming tech stocks and the broader market, as the coronavirus pandemic has pushed more businesses to the cloud and away from physical data centers.Dell, which acquired its 80% stake in VMware through the 2016 acquisition of data storage maker EMC, said in July that it was exploring a VMware spinoff to Dell shareholders, in part to enhance strategic flexibility. Any deal wouldnt happen before September 2021, Dell said.In addition to greater partnership opportunities, operating independently could make VMware a more attractive destination for top talent and give the company more freedom to do deals, Gelsinger said.I cant effectively use my equity for acquisitions today, he said. Theres a very tight ownership range I have to live inside of.Thats not to say VMware has shied away from dealmaking. Since becoming CEO in 2012, Gelsinger has completed more than 40 acquisitions, including Carbon Black, CloudHealth and VeloCloud, helping bolster VMwares subscription software business. He also led a partnership with Amazon Web Services in 2016, so customers could use a combination of cloud and on-premises services for their workloads.After the coronavirus pandemic forced companies to close their offices, some VMware customers became more reliant on cloud services from AWS. That theme has played out across the cloud infrastructure landscape. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told analysts in April that we have seen two years worth of digital transformation in two months, referring to sales, customers service and security all moving into a world of remote everything.VMwares license revenue dropped 7% in the quarter that ended July 31, compared with 2% growth in the prior quarter. The companys cloud and subscription unit grew 44%. Gelsinger said some companies are heading in the other direction with their infrastructure, because cloud costs can get hefty. Comcast, he said, had about half its capacity in the cloud and the other half in traditional data centers and is increasing the portion of on-premises work to 70%.That split gives them a much better economic model, Gelsinger said.There are also laws in various countries that prevent some applications from being hosted in the cloud, and there are other instances where data doesnt need to move over the internet so its better served on-premises. VMware is still investing in its traditional business. On Tuesday, it announced that it is working with chipmaker Nvidia to make it easier for customers to run artificial intelligence workloads using VMwares vSphere server-management software.As the company heads toward a possible ownership change, Gelsinger said investors are looking for leadership continuity.Im a very happy CEO these days, and I dont expect that to change, Gelsinger said.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC.WATCH: VMware CEO Patrick Gelsinger on its second-quarter results
Early movers FIATY, AAPL, GOOG, BAC, CPB, S & more#Check out which companies are making headlines before the  bell:   Fiat —The automaker finally reached a long-sought  agreement to buy the shares of Chrysler it doesnt already own  for $3.65 billion. The stock has been owned by a United  Auto Workers union health care trust.  Apple–The iPhone maker was downgraded to market perform from  outperform at Wells Fargo, which points to valuation as well as  possible profit margin pressure at whatever time Apple introduces  another new version of the iPhone.  Bank of America–Citi upgraded B of A to buy from  neutral, saying the bank is no longer impacted by legacy  issues.
Amazon and Google are going to be in every aspect#Until recently, Amazon and Google competed for presence in our homes through their own gadgets: Smart speakers like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, TV add-ons like Chromecast and Fire TV and even home security systems like Nest and Ring.But, at CES 2019, that competition was brought to a boil as partners from both companies launched dozens of products that will bring Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant into nearly every aspect of our lives.Ive been attending CES for more than a decade, and its always home to all sorts of new doohickeys, from robots to health trackers and the latest in TV technology. While those things were all on display this year, too, I couldnt help but notice the massive presence of Google and Amazon, two companies that didnt even exist at CES a couple of years ago. Thats because their smart assistants, the ones you can control by voice, are being built into almost every category of new product that was introduced at CES, from TVs to ovens — even lawnmowers and a toilet.
Economists get more bearish on Singapore’s outlook#The outlook for Singapores economic growth was trimmed yet  again, according to an official survey of forecasters released  Wednesday.  The December survey of professional forecasters, sent out in late  November, by the city-states central bank, the Monetary  Authority of Singapore (MAS), found economists turned more  bearish since the previous survey.   They expected Singapores economy would grow just 1.5 percent in  2017 on average, down from the September surveys forecast for  1.8 percent and the June surveys projection of 2.1  percent.   The latest forecasts for 2017 growth ranged from 0.7 percent to  2.3 percent.   The December survey, which had 22 respondents, doesnt reflect  the MAS own forecasts.  In a statement released December 2, the MAS said it expected  Singapores gross domestic product (GDP) would rise by 1-3  percent in 2017 after rising an estimated 1.0-1.5 percent in  2016.
New York Shouldnt Imitate Ontarios Pensions#One of the biggest mistakes investors in managed funds make is  chasing returns. Now, New York City pensions look as if they want  to make chasing returns official policy.Larry Schloss, the citys chief investment officer, wants New  York to emulate the Ontario teachers pension fund. Its easy to  see why. The fund has seen a 9.6 percent return on its  investments since 2003, compared with an 8 percent gain in New  Yorks pension funds.Whats more, Ontario pays far less in fees to asset managers  because it actually makes investment decisions on its own. To do  that, it employs real live investment professionals, paying  competitive salaries. By contrast, the guys running New Yorks  pension system get paid an average of $100,000 each. Schloss earns just $224,000.He imagines that the city could hire a VP at MetLife who  makes 500,000 bucks. But this is probably unrealistic.
German health minister says the country is considering steps to#Germany is considering how to implement a gradual recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, the countrys health minister, Jens Spahn, told CNBC on Monday. We are thinking about step by step, that is important ... going back to a new normal, Spahn said on Closing Bell.Spahn, who was speaking from Berlin, stressed that it will indeed be a new normal because all the measures we have taken like keeping distance, wearing masks, no parties ... are definitely measures that need to be there in place for months to come. But Germany is in a place to begin considering what a recovery looks like because its rate of new infections has continued to slow, Spahn said. He cited the effectiveness of social distancing measures and applauded the countrys residents for taking them seriously. There are more than 128,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Germany and around 3,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. Spahn said the German government is now seeking to find the right balance between health and economic considerations. I would say its not the health of people versus the economy because they are very much interlinked, Spahn said. You need a strong economy to have a well-equipped health system, for example. Or unemployment, a recession, is harmful for the mental and physical health of people, too. Germany has received praise, albeit with some caution, for its response to the Covid-19 outbreak. Spahn said he was humble but not overconfident about how Germany has handled the spread of the coronavirus.He cited the strength of Germanys health-care system, in particular its high number of intensive care unit beds, as one reason why the country was well equipped to respond to the pandemic. The country also placed an early emphasis on testing capacity, Spahn said. He said the the country had a strong network of labs, and he noted that the first diagnostic test for Covid-19 was developed in Germany in January. Its like pointing a flashlight into the dark, Spahn said of testing. If you dont do it, youll just see different shades of gray. With extensive testing, you can really see whats going on. You dont just see the symptomatic cases, but the mild and asymptomatic ones, too. Read all of CNBCs coronavirus coverage here
25 highest-paid hedge fund managers made $32 billion in#The 25 highest-paid hedge fund managers made a record $32 billion in 2020, up more than 50% over 2019, according to Institutional Investors Rich List.A total of 15 hedge fund managers made $1 billion or more, compared with only eight in 2019. The big gains during the coronavirus pandemic, coupled with the public debate over hedge funds in the wake of the GameStop controversy, is likely to draw criticism from lawmakers and the public over hedge fund pay and fairness in financial markets.The top earner was Israel Izzy Englander of Millennium Management, earning $3.8 billion. His flagship fund was up 26% last year, which was its best return in 20 years. Like many of the top-performing funds last year, Millennium relies more on stock picking than quantitative strategies using computer algorithms.In second place is Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies, who earned $2.6 billion. His investors, however, didnt do as well. Renaissance Technologies three main funds for outside investors were down 20% to 30%, according to report. But its Medallion fund, which is mainly for employees, was up 76%. Simons retired as chairman on Jan. 1.Chase Coleman of Tiger Global came in third place, with a $2.5 billion payday. The fund was an early investor in tech stocks and overseas plays that did well during the pandemic, giving his fund a 48% return. His partner Scott Shleifer, the head of Tigers private equity business, was tied for eighth with $1.5 billion. Shleifer just bought the most expensive home ever sold in Florida, paying more than $130 million for a newly built mansion in Palm Beach.Ken Griffin of Citadel, who is at the center of the GameStop debate, came in fourth, with $1.8 billion as his fund was up 24%. Steve Cohen of Point72 Asset Management, who owns the Mets, was tied for fifth, along with David Tepper of Appaloosa, both at $1.7 billion.Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly attributed Mets ownership.
2 teams in NCAA finals is a good thing. Ask#For the second time in 10 years, the University of Connecticut is  sending both its mens and womens basketball teams to the NCAA finals.  And that means this years Huskies  squads are again likely to be a boon for the university and its bottom line.  Its infinitely priceless, said Mike Enright, associate  director of athletics for communications at UConn, referencing  the Huskies Final Four appearances. It brings great notoriety  for the teams, but it also brings great notoriety for the  university. Read MoreBostons Green Monster  goes digital with selfies  Enright said that based on observation from the 2004 season, when  the Huskies sent both teams to the Final Four and won both  championship titles, higher merchandise sales on items like T-shirts and caps will likely be one of the most tangible effects  of the increased attention.  We saw a doubling of our money resulting from the licensing of  our goods, he said. We doubled it from approximately half a  million to $1 million.  Next seasons ticket sales and prices could also see a boost,  said Chris Matcovich, vice president of data and communications  at TiqIQ.  Youll see an initial bump at the beginning of the season for  early conference matchups, said Matcovich. It definitely  increases the level of enthusiasm.  There may also be an increase in financial contributions from  alumni, said UConns Enright. The school currently has an annual  athletics budget of $62 million.
UPDATE 1-Storm Sandy knocks US Oct auto sales below estimates#* Sandy caused industry to lose 20,000-25,000 sales -Ford* Industry likely to miss sales estimates for October* Still, GM, Chrysler report best October sales in 5 years* Ford October sales edge up; Toyotas up 16 pct* Ford shares down 1.4 pct, GM down 0.6 pct(Adds results from GM, Ford, Toyota and VW, adds comments by Ford, GM and VW, adds stock prices)DETROIT, Nov 1 (Reuters) - General Motors Co and Chrysler Group LLC both reported their strongest U.S. sales for the month of October since the financial crisis sent both U.S. automakers into bankruptcy, but the destruction of storm Sandy will cause the sector to miss overall sales expectations.Ford Motor Cos sales last month edged up 0.4 percent, while Toyota Motor Corps sales rose about 16 percent.GM sales rose 4.7 percent to 195,764 vehicles, while those at Chrysler, an affiliate of Italys Fiat SpA, increased 10 percent to 126,185 vehicles. Both totals were the best either automaker had seen since 2007, before the U.S. economy went into recession and caused a drastic decline in sales that led GM and Chrysler to file for bankruptcy in 2009.Still, results of Ford, Chrysler and Toyota came in below expectations, while GM missed some analysts estimates, suggesting that the U.S. industry will have a hard time reaching the 14.9 million-vehicle annual sales rate economists had predicted for the month before Sandy pummeled the U.S. East Coast.  Auto sales are an early indicator each month of U.S. consumer demand.The massive storm, which hit New York City on Monday evening, hurt U.S. demand at the end of the month, with Ford officials estimating the lost sales for the entire industry at 20,000 to 25,000 vehicles.Ford officials said that would hurt the annual rate by 300,000 vehicles, although analysts have said the industry would likely make up any lost sales in November. GM officials agreed, saying Sandy hurt the annual rate by at least 300,000 vehicles.GM said it sees an October annual sales rate in the range of 14.4 million vehicles. Ford estimates the rate in the high 14 million range including heavy and medium-duty trucks, in line with GM.Volkswagen AGs U.S. operations chief, Jonathan Browning, said the industry would fall short of the 10 to 11 percent gain many had predicted.``This is not yet a full-blown recovery, Browning told reporters on a conference call. ``The overall environment is one of improving optimism, but its still not a strong positive development in terms of the overall economy. He added that demand had been choppy in some regions even before Sandy.Before the massive storm hit, analysts had predicted the industry would show an 11 percent sales gain, led by Toyota and Honda Motor Co, which benefited from increased demand for compact cars as gasoline prices remained high across the country.Many automakers still made gains in the month as rising home prices, attractive vehicle financing options and Americans growing need to replace their aging cars spurred more consumers to showrooms. That bodes well for the future, a top GM executive said.``Year over year, the light vehicle selling rate has increased for eight consecutive quarters without a tailwind from the residential housing sector, but that is starting to change, Kurt McNeil, GMs vice president of U.S. sales operations, said in a statement. ``If these trends continue, housing may be the final piece of the puzzle that lifts sales above 15 million units on an annual basis.Over the last five years, the U.S. auto sector has undergone a wrenching overhaul that led to plant closures, job losses and the government-financed bankruptcy restructurings of GM and Chrysler. Ford also overhauled its U.S. operations, but did not take a government bailout.The October sales report will be the last before Election Day, marking the end of a contentious U.S. presidential race that has repeatedly thrust GM and Chrysler into the spotlight in televised debates, stump speeches and campaign advertisements.The sales report also caps a busy week for the U.S. auto industry, which saw third-quarter profit reports from all three Detroit automakers.GM shares were down 0.6 percent at $25.34 on Thursday morning, while Ford shares were down 1.4 percent at $11.00. The broad S&P 500 Index  was up 1 percent.(Additional reporting by Paul Lienert and Deepa Seetharaman in Detroit; editing by Gerald E. McCormick and Matthew Lewis)
AGL Energy Eyes Deal with Macquarie for AlintaAGL#AGL Energy, Australias largest energy retailer, said on Friday it would team up with Macquarie Bank to acquire the 67% of the AlintaAGL retail business it does not own, if Macquarie makes a revised bid for Alinta.Macquaries first offer for energy infrastructure group Alinta was trumped in March by investment firm Babcock & Browns A$7.4 billion (US$6.1 billion) cash and stock proposal, which was recommended by Alintas board. AGL said in a statement that it was also negotiating with Babcock & Brown to acquire the retail business, but stated that it has not entered an agreement with either party. AlintaAGL, spun off in an asset swap deal between AGL and Alinta last year, is a joint venture company that holds Alintas Western Australia retail and generation businesses. Macquarie Bank said in a separate statement that it was still considering acquiring Alinta, which had put itself up for sale after receiving a management buyout proposal in January. Local media reported on Friday that Macquarie was close to submitting a revised A$15.45 a share, all-cash offer for Alinta.  Macquaries first offer in March was a A$15.45 per share cash and scrip bid. Alintas board had rejected the proposal, saying  the deal included shares in an untested new vehicle. Under the agreement with AGL, Macquarie would sell to AGL the AlintaAGL power retailing business AGL does not already own in exchange for AGL agreeing to sell to Macquarie its interests in several Alinta generators, according to newspaper reports. Macquarie may be planning to use the proceeds of any AGL deal, which could be about A$400 million, to fund a cash return to Alinta shareholders as part of a sweetened offer. A source familiar with the situation said there was a Friday deadline for Macquarie to return information it had access to on Alinta, but that did not mean it had to submit an offer by Friday. Another source said Macquarie was still working on finalizing an underwriting package for a bid. Babcock offered Alinta shareholders A$8.50 in cash per share as well as 7.83 shares of Babcock & Brown Infrastructure, 1.30 shares of Babcock & Brown Wind, 3.31 shares of Babcock & Brown Power and 1.51 Australia Pipeline Trust units for every five Alinta shares. In a bid to sweeten the deal, Babcock, which has teamed up with state-owned utility Singapore Power, said on April 16 it would offer shareholders with 1,000 Alinta shares or less the opportunity to receive all cash.
Raytheon and United Technologies agree to all-stock merger that would#Raytheon and United Technologies on Sunday announced they would merge in an all-stock deal, a tie-up that would create a behemoth in the fast-growing defense and aerospace sectors.The combination would bring together United Technologies booming aerospace business that makes everything from jet engines, cockpit controls and airplane seats with Tomahawk missile maker Raytheon.The companies would have combined annual sales of around $74 billion, the companies said. That would make the new company, which they are planning to call Raytheon Technologies, the second-largest aerospace and defense company in the U.S. by revenue, behind Boeing.The combination of United Technologies and Raytheon will define the future of aerospace and defense, United Technologies chairman and CEO Greg Hayes said in a release. By joining forces, we will have unsurpassed technology and expanded R&D capabilities that will allow us to invest through business cycles and address our customers highest priorities.United Technologies has reaped the benefits from searing global aircraft demand and has been beefing up its commercial aerospace business, which includes jet engine maker Pratt and Whitney. In November 2018, it closed its acquisition of Rockwell Collins.The two companies have little overlap and may not face strong regulatory push-back to their deal, said Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst at Teal Group.The new company would be headquartered in the Boston area, the two firms said in the release. Raytheon is based in Waltham, Mass., a Boston suburb.If completed, shareholders in Farmington, Conn.-based United Technologies would own 57% of the new company while Raytheons would own 43% on a diluted basis.The deal, which the two companies called a merger of equals, is expected to close in the first half of 2020, they said.Like other industrial conglomerates, United Technologies shedding businesses to focus on highly profitable units. It is the middle of spinning its Otis elevator business and its Carrier air conditioning unit into separate companies. The merger with Raytheon wouldnt affect that process and it is still on track to close in the first half of 2020, the companies said Sunday.United Technologies chief executive Hayes would become CEO of the combined company, and Raytheons CEO Thomas Kennedy would become chairman. Two years after the deal closes Hayes would become chairman.Raytheon and United Technologies have a combined market value of nearly $166 billion. Raytheon shareholders will get 2.3348 shares in the new company for each Raytheon share, the firms said.
House Foreign Affairs chairman blasts Trump administration for report on#The chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Friday blasted the Trump administration for claiming in a new report that it had authority to order the controversial killing last month of Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani in Iraq under Congress authorization in 2002 for the use of military force against Iraq.Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., the committees chairman, argued that the administrations new report to Congress about the Jan. 3 attack on Soleimani directly contradicts the Presidents false assertion that he attacked Iran to prevent an imminent attack against United States personnel and embassies.The administrations explanation in this report makes no mention of any imminent threat and shows that the justification the President offered to the American people was false, plain and simple, said Engel in a prepared statement.He and other Democrats already were skeptical about President Donald Trumps legal rationale for the attack without prior authorization from Congress.The administrations report made public Friday says that Trump directed this action in response to an escalating series of attacks in preceding months by Iran and Iran-back militias on United States forces and interests in the Middle East region.The report also said that the attack on Soleimani at Baghdads airport was consistent with a longstanding interpretation of the Presidents authority under both Article II of the Constitution and the 2002 authorization of use of force in Iraq.Engel, in his statement, called that argument absurd.To make matters worse, to avoid having to justify its actions to Congress, the administration falsely claims Congress had already authorized the strike under the 2002 Iraq war resolution, Engel said.This legal theory is absurd. The 2002 authorization was passed to deal with Saddam Hussein, he said. This law had nothing to do with Iran or Iranian government officials in Iraq.The chairman added, To suggest that 18 years later this authorization could justify killing an Iranian official stretches the law far beyond anything Congress ever intended. I was pleased to join many of my colleagues in voting to repeal the outdated Iraq war authorization, and I hope the Senate will follow suit.In its report, the administration said the purpose of the attack on Soleimani was to protect United States personnel, to deter Iran from conducting or supporting further attacks against United States forces and interests, to degrade Irans and [its] Qods Force-backed militias ability to conduct attacks, and to end Irans strategic escalation of attacks on, and threats to U.S. interests.At the time of his death, Soleimani, 62, was commander of Irans Quds Force, the foreign operations wing of the elite paramilitary Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.Trump administration officials said after the strike that Soleimani had been planning imminent attacks on Americans and as a result had to be stopped.A week after his killing, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, There was no doubt that there were a series of imminent attacks that were being plotted by Qasem Soleimani.But Pompeo, in an interview with Fox News, added, We dont know precisely when and we dont know precisely where, but it was real, Pompeo said in an interview that aired Thursday night on Fox News.NBC News reported in mid-January that Trump authorized Soleimanis killing seven months before he actually was killed.The presidential directive in June came with the condition that Trump would have final signoff on any specific operation to kill Soleimani, NBC reported, citing five current and former senior administration officials.NBC News noted that the timing of that directive could undermine the administrations already publicly stated rationale for the killing.

Is Goldilocks Getting Wrinkles?#A market expert told CNBC that the Goldilocks economic scenario is getting a little long in the tooth and is especially concerned with the financial sector, which may show cracks in the façade this week.The stock market is overvalued, said Richard Suttmeier, chief market strategist at RightSide.com. Im viewing this as another opportunity for investors to lighten up on positions.Suttmeier said he was particularly worried about the financial sector. Sure, some of the financial stocks are rallying, but thats because theyre coming off pretty much near 52-week lows, he said.But Charles Lieberman, chief investment officer at Advisors Capital Management, said the market has a lot further to go.I think those sectors are actually very interesting to buy because they are at lows, said Lieberman. They havent participated in the rally.

May, in fact, was revised down further from 38,000 to just 11,000.  Taking the Verizon strike into account, adding 35,000 to May and subtracting 35,000 from June, the last two months of payroll gains are more like 46,000 and 252,000 respectively.   Still, the improvement at the end of the second-quarter does little to reinstate a positive trajectory in hiring – remember its not about just one or two months data, it is about the trend pace.  The three-month average rose from 115,000 to 140,000 in June, down markedly, however, from a near 300,000 pace at the end of 2015 when the Fed opted to raise interest rates for the first time in nine years.  In other words, while the Feds preemptive policy adjustment was based on expectations of further improvement in the labor market and inflation, the data have still-failed to evolve as expected.    The unemployment rate ticked up from 4.7 percent to 4.9 percent in June as nearly half a million workers moved back into the labor force – nearly the same amount that dropped out the month prior.  Household employment rose, however, by only 67k in June prompting a rise in the unemployment rate, as well as the participation rate from 62.6 percent to 62.7 percent.  Average hourly earnings rose just 0.1 percent in June, enough, however, to boost the annual pace of earnings up to 2.6 percent, a new high for 2016.  If sustained, which is itself a big if, positive, above-trend earnings growth would offer the Federal Reserve at least one strong indication of continued improvement in the U.S. labor market.  As of late, however, it is still too soon to suggest a sustainable upward trend as wages have been increasingly volatile month-to-month.  Finally, the workweek remains unchanged at 34.4 in June, as if has for the past five months.  Heres the bottom line:  Prior to the violent reaction in the financial markets following the Brexit, several Committee members noted the downside risks to the Feds outlook for growth in economic activity and for further improvement in labor market conditions.  This mornings June employment report, while a welcome improvement from a disappointing rise in May, has done little to help quell the Committees well-founded concerns surrounding labor market strength or the markets concerns of a recession over the next 12-24 months.  After all, although the headline increase in May was severely disappointing and seemingly an anomaly, the pace of hiring has been slowing for some time.  Near 300,000 at the end of last year, the three-month average slowed to fewer than 200,000 in the first quarter before dropping to just above 100,000 as of late.  Thus, even the outsized nominal rise in June of 287,000, beating market expectations, is not enough to reestablish an improving trend in hiring.  Rather, a still-weakened trajectory will continue to fuel the Committees concerns surrounding the underlying momentum of the U.S. labor market, and the domestic economy as a whole, into the second-half of the year and beyond, perpetuating the Feds inability to raise rates anytime soon.  In other words, if rates were poised to stay low for longer, the Feds acknowledgement of recent weakness on the domestic front coupled with global market volatility suggest rates are now likely to be much lower for much, much, much longer.

Please refresh the page if you do not see a player above at that time.]New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is scheduled to hold a press briefing Wednesday on the Covid-19 vaccine distribution plans as the threat of another economic shutdown looms over the state.Last week, Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio noted that the state might close nonessential businesses in some regions in January. For weeks, Cuomo has said that he will implement more restrictions in parts of the state where hospitals are overwhelmed to the point that they cannot care for every patient.But he has noted that its up to residents of New York to follow public health precautions to limit the spread of the coronavirus and avoid a shutdown.Of course a shutdown in January is possible, Cuomo said last week.

5 Stocks Insiders Love Right Now#Corporate insiders sell their own companies stock for a number of reasons. They might need the cash for a big personal purchase such as a new house or yacht, or they might need the cash to fund a charity. Sometimes they sell as part of a planned selling program that they have put in place for diversification purposes, which allows them to sell stock in stages instead of selling all at one price.

John Edwards: Is He The New Robert F. Kennedy?#In mimicking Robert F. Kennedys 1967 tour through impoverished American communities, John Edwards strikes a resonant chord with me. My father covered that Kennedy trip for the Washington Post. A photo from that experience hangs on the wall in the kitchen of my family home. But is he the Bobby Kennedyof the 2008 presidential race?Certainly the former North Carolina senator would like to be--and with good reason. RFK, in a different way than his brother JFK,has become a mythic Democratic hero. He had an ability to appeal across racial and income lines in ways any thinking Democrat could want to emulate. Some of the comparisons are apt. John Edwards has drawn flak forhis work with the Fortress Investment Group hedge fundand his $400 haircuts. Kennedy was a rich man too. Notwithstanding our sustained economic growth and booming stock market, poverty rates remain comparable to levels of a generation ago; in the most recent Census Data, from 2005, slightly more than 12 percent of the population is poor. The poverty population has become younger, as Medicare and Social Security have dramatically reduced economic deprivation among the elderly. Poverty among whites has fallen substantially, but they represent a declining proportion of the overall population. Just as RFK was in his day, Edwards stands widely accused of political opportunism. He likes to say that hes emphasizing poverty issues against the prevailing wisdom of political consultants, since theres little political upside in appealing to the poor when middle class votes and upscale executives political contributions drive U.S. elections. In fact, theres a very large political benefit in championing the poor among Democratic primary voters. But Edwards has at least three big problems in trying to replicate Kennedys political feat. One is that Barack Obama--the first African American candidate with a real shot at becoming president -- is for many voters already filling the RFK roles for many voters of both races. A second is that immigration has made Hispanic voters a growing proportion of the Democratic primary electorate, and so far Hispanic voters have flocked to Hillary Clinton. The third is that the composition of the Democratic electorate has changed. Many of the blue-collar Democrats Kennedy appealed to are now Republicans, drawn by the GOPs appear on social issues or security concerns. That leaves Democrats more dependent than ever on both the top of the income scale as well as the bottom; Democrats nearly broke even in 2006 among voters earning more than $100,000 a year. Edwards aims to appeal to both upscale and downscale voters at the same time. Despite his work at Fortress, he led other top Democratic candidates in embracing higher taxes on private equity and hedge fund managers. Hes also pushing universal health care and a tougher line on U.S. trade policy. One early sign of the viability of his strategy will come in his third quarter fund-raising. So far he boasts some loyal allies from American business; wealthy telecommunications executive Leo Hindery is a top economic adviser.

Cramer adds new stocks, recommends buying 12 laggards in his#CNBCs Jim Cramer on Monday reviewed and made changes to his pandemic playbook to bring more diversification to his coronavirus index.The Cramer Covid-19 Index, a basket of 100 stocks he determined can work in a coronavirus-plagued market, has outgained the major indexes since Cramer last updated the stock catalog.When you look at the biggest winners in the index, theyre overwhelmingly tech companies that help facilitate the stay-at-home economy, and a lot of these got hit today, the Mad Money host said.Cramer dropped two health-based stocks and one packaged foods company to make room for two cloud-based names and one gold business. VMware, Fastly and Newmont Mining were substituted for Baxter International, GlaxoSmithKline and Kellogg.Baxter, a medical supplies company, was removed because of its high exposure to voluntary surgeries delayed by the impact of the health crisis on hospitals. GlaxoSmithKline, a drug company thats working on a Covid-19 vaccine, was taken off because the stock is not enticing many investors, Cramer said. Kellogg, the cereal producing giant, was axed because the stock is lagging and the Cramer index already contains seven other similar plays.As for the new additions, Cramer added VMware, one of his cloud king stocks, because the stock is cheap on an earnings basis and the prospect that the company could be spun off from Dell. Fastly, a cloud content delivery network whose stock price has increased sevenfold since bottoming in March, is one that in hindsight Cramer wishes he included when he created the index in April. Newmont is a gold company that can provide investors more insurance against economic chaos as the country continues to deal with fallout from the coronavirus crisis, he said.The biggest winners on Crammers list – Zoom Video, Spotify, Zscaler, DocuSign, Etsy, The Trade Desk, Livongo Health, Square, Peloton and Cloudflare – are among the top plays in the stay-at-home economy.As the pandemic flares up again, get ready after the industrial rotation ends. Its time to circle back to the blue-chip Covid stocks that are still way off their highs. Thats what offers the best risk-reward, he said. I love a rotation. They throw out the good, they buy the bad and then they change their mind two days later.

Cruz sponsors bill allowing governors to deny entrance to refugees#Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Rep. Ted Poe reintroduced a controversial  bill that allows governors to bar refugees from entering their  state, The Hill reported.  The bill, entitled The State Refugee Security Act, was  initially introduced last year, The  Hill Reported on Tuesday. It would require federal authorities to notify a  state 21 days before settling a refugee there, during which the  governor can request adequate assurance that the  refugee is not a security threat. If the federal authorities can not provide this, the refugee will not be able to settle in the state.  The first obligation of the president is to keep this country  safe as commander in chief, Cruz said in a statement to The  Hill. I am encouraged that, unlike the previous  administration, one of President Trumps top priorities is to  defeat radical Islamic terrorism.The act echoes the sentiment of President Donald Trumps plan to bar Muslims from entering the United States. While he proposed this plan during the primaries, it is unclear at this time if he still supports it.Click here to read the full story from The Hill.

Bring Back Recess#Spending a little too much time playing Call of Duty? Glued to Facebook? Too much Tweeting (hello, Congressman Weiner!)? Or just watching too much SportsCenter? Some New Yorkers have started a web biz which they hope will get people out more. Can they make a lethargic nation start moving? The site is called Blood, Sweat & Cheers, or BSC. The motto: bring back recess. Every day the site sends out emails to subscribers highlighting fun, offbeat, sometimes sweat inducing activities. This is no Groupon deal where you get half off on a massage. First, there are no coupons — yet. And BSC is trying to find the most unique, offbeat activities possible, like a muddy obstacle course race, Marathon Training Made Fun, Social and Easy, Bingo at the Standard Hotel, or The Ugly Dog Pageant. Put me down for the last one. The site launched in April just for New York but will go national later this month. How will Blood, Sweat & Cheersmake money? You bring up a good question, BSCs Jonathan Ages tells me. His team is selling banner ads on the website and inside the daily emails. By the way, in-email advertising sells at roughly ten times the rate of website advertising, he says. Future plans include sponsored articles which will be clearly labeled as such, and a group-buying arm like Groupon.

Greek PM Tsipras says he seeks no rift with Europe#Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said on Saturday that he  sought no rift with Europe after his cash-strapped country  submitted a list of reforms to its lenders in a bid to secure  much-needed funds.  Tsipras leftist government agreed an extension to its  240-million euro bailout fund in February, albeit with aid  frozen, and now must agree on a set of reforms which it sent to  its EU-IMF creditors on Friday in order to stave off bankruptcy.  The austerity-weary nation will run out of money by April 20, a  source told Reuters on Tuesday, if it does not unlock much-needed  funding.  The liquidity problem is naturally hampering the situation but I  believe that will be tackled immediately once we reach an  agreement over reforms, Tsipras said in an interview with  Sundays Real News newspaper.  After answering a question regarding government attempts to deal  with corruption, Tsipras was asked whether he wanted a rift or a  solution with Greeces partners: My view has always been the  same: a break from corruption, a solution with Europe.Read More  Fitch downgrades Greece to CCC from B  Earlier Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis, one of Tsipras  most left-wing ministers, hit out at a Germanised European  Union.. for tightening week by week the noose around the Greek  economy.

I come to bury Bitcoin, not to praise it: UBS#Cryptocurrencies are nearing the end of the road, and its time to do away with the digital coins, UBS Gobal Wealth Managements chief economist said.UBS Paul Donovan, who has never been a fan of cryptocurrency, wrote earlier this week: I come to bury Bitcoin, not to praise it.These things were never going to be currencies. Theyre not going to be currencies at any point in the future, he said Thursday on CNBCs Fast Money. Theyre fatally flawed.Bitcoin received lots of love during the 2017 holiday season when it began rallying to nearly $20,000. But Donovan was skeptical then, warning that it could be destructive in the long term.Right from the start of the hike in late last year, it was fairly obvious that this was going to end badly, unfortunately, for some of the people who werent protected by any kind of regulation and got sucked into the process, he told CNBC.After peaking, bitcoin is now trading around $4,330. Overall, the cryptocurrency market has lost about $700 billion since reaching highs in January.Donovan thinks the cryptocurrency could be in its death throes because losing 80 percent value is not healthy. Government, he said, is one of the main obstacles to bitcoin, adding the idea of digital currency replacing the dollar is quite a leap.The main problem with these things, the absolute fundamental flaw, is that theyre never going to be a store of value, he said. Every economist knows the store of value is about balancing supply and demand, and with cryptocurrencies, you cannot control the supply in response to the drop in demand.WATCH: When bitcoin hit $100 for the first time in 2013
Jon Stewart joins Stephen Colbert to mock that angry groundhog#Its been 351 days since Jon Stewart sat behind the desk of a  late-night talk show and delivered jokes about US politics and  the days headlines.  In the time since Stewart left The Daily Show (on August 6,  2015), his many proteges have spread far and wide across the TV  landscape. Samantha Bee is on TBS. John Oliver has reached new  heights on HBO. Trevor Noah took over The Daily Show. And Stephen  Colbert has landed at CBSs Late Show. (Stewart himself has a  deal with HBO that hell presumably start producing content for  one of these days.)  But something else happened in those 351 days: Donald Trump  became the Republican partys nominee for president. And in all  that time, doesnt it seem like Stewart would have some pretty  great jokes to share about a man he dubs an angry groundhog?  More from Vox:Why Hillary Clinton, not Donald Trump, was the unifying  figure at theRNCDonald Trump gave Bernie Sanders a shout-out andSanders  was not amusedTed Cruz played Donald Trumps reality TV game —    and won  As it turns out, he did! After he popped up on the latest episode  of Colberts show (where hes been turning in appearances all  week), the host ceded the floor to his old boss, and Stewart  proceeded to lay into Fox Newss praising of Trump — for the  exact same things theyve criticized  for over the  course of his presidency.  (If youre wondering where Colbert was this whole time, he was  crouching just behind the desk, so he could pop up for the  occasional joke, as youll see from this Tweet he shared.) Stephen Colbert tweet  It was a nice taste of vintage Jon Stewart, for all those whove  enjoyed the many, many shows his Daily  Show spawned but wanted something from the man himself.  He performed a quick tune from Hamilton. He dubbed  Sean Hannity Lumpy. He learned the hard way that he was on live  TV.  It was all a fun bit, made even more fun by Stewarts obvious  rustiness when it came to hosting a TV show. But the best part  was its conclusion: a lengthy, vintage rant from Stewart that  deserves to be quoted (mostly) in full. Stewart clearly stopped by Late  Show to offer his old pal a boost in the ratings  — creatively, the show is finally coming close to the  heights of The  Colbert Report, so this was a good time for  viewers to sample the program — but it was also fun to watch  him shake off the cobwebs and deliver jokes to a camera again.  Heres hoping the next time isnt another 351 days from  now.

Shopping for a home? It will take a lot longer#Homes today are selling in about 40 days on average, almost two weeks faster than a year ago. But it is taking a lot longer for shoppers to find a home to buy.Two-thirds of buyers are shopping for more than three months before signing a deal, according to a new survey from the National Association of Home Builders. Why so long? They cant find a home they can afford.Forty-two percent of buyers surveyed said prices were out of reach for the homes they wanted. Home prices have been rising at a fast clip in the past year – faster than income growth and inflation. The primary reason is a lack of homes for sale, especially lower-priced homes.Its the inventory problem that were having out there that is causing these long delays in pulling the trigger, said Rose Quint, assistant vice president for survey research at the NAHB. Its lack of affordability, although the other problems are serious as well.About a third of those surveyed said they couldnt find a home with features they wanted or in a neighborhood they wanted. Back to prices though, 27 percent said they kept getting outbid on their offers. Bidding wars are now the rule, not the exception, in most major U.S. markets.Home prices rose in 92 percent of the nations measured housing markets at the end of last year, according to the National Association of Realtors. Twenty-six markets (15 percent) saw double-digit increases in prices. That was more than in the third quarter.These consistent, multiyear price gains have certainly been great news for homeowners, and especially for those who were at one time in a negative equity situation, said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the Realtors. However, the shortage of new homes being built over the past decade is really burdening local markets and making home buying less affordable.The lack of supply should benefit the homebuilders, and it may be already. Mortgage applications to purchase a newly built home jumped 18 percent in January compared with a year ago, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.This complements other positive news on U.S. job growth suggesting that economic fundamentals are strong, said Lynn Fisher, MBA vice president of research and economics, in a release. Based on applications, we estimate that new home sales were running at a pace of 700,000 on a seasonally adjusted annual basis – the highest such estimate in our survey which began in 2013.The jump in demand is sizable, but the number of new homes for sale is still below historical averages and far below the number needed to satisfy both new and pent-up demand. The largest generation, millennials, are now moving into their homebuying years in force, but clearly not finding what they can afford.The whole industry has been clamoring for builders to increase their production, but theyre trying, said Quint. The prices of lumber and labor and land are increasing so fast, theyre constrained at the bottom, at how low a price they can really achieve.The NAHB is predicting a 5 percent increase in new home construction in 2018 compared with 2017. The market could absorb far more, not just in major metropolitan areas, but across the nation.

Market Insider/Tuesday Look Ahead#Stocks held their own Monday, even after the shocking demise of Bear Stearns. But the market no doubt benefited from the view of many investors that the Fed will deliver a hefty rate cut when it meets Tuesday. Right now, traders are betting on a full point rate cut by the Fed, which would take the target Fed funds rate to 2 percent. Just Friday, the Fed funds futures showed traders believed the Fed would cut by 0.75 percent. But the weekend rescue of Bear Stearns in a Fed-engineered buyout by JP Morgan  and other extraordinary moves by the Fed changed that view. Two investment banks report earnings before the bell Tuesday, and that news will also be key in setting the course for markets. Other important news includes producer price inflation data, due at 8:30 a.m., and housing starts, also reported at 8:30 a.m. One of the most encouraging events for stocks in recent sessions is the pricing Tuesday afternoon of the giant $18 billion Visa IPO. The offering is expected to price after the bell Tuesday, and start trading Wednesday. There has been some real investor excitement about the offering, which is expected to price between $37 and $42 per share. Earnings CentralGoldman  is expected to report first quarter earnings of $2.58 per share, a decline of 61 percent, on revenues of $7.47 billion, a 41 percent decline. Lehman is expected to report earnings per share of $0.72, a 63 percent decline, on revenues of $3.351 billion, a 34 percent decrease. The shares of financial institutions were under pressure Monday after the Bear Stearns news, with Wall Streets investment banks particularly hard hit. The S&P financial sector was down 1.5 percent. Lehman stock was the most tattered of all the firms as an uncomfortable level of rumors swirled around its shares. The stock at some points during the day was down more than a third, and it traded on volume of 224 million shares, nearly eight times its 10 day average of 33 million shares. Lehman battled back. CEO Richard Fuld said in a statement that the Feds announcement Sunday that it would allow investment banks to use its discount window takes the liquidity issue off the table for the entire industry. Previously, commercial banks were the only institutions that could use the Feds short term borrowing window. Traders said the Feds rule change was a big reason why stock trading was so orderly Monday. Lehmans CFO Erin Callan is expected to appear on Closing Bell Tuesday. Chop, ChopDeutsche Bank chief U.S. economist Joe LaVorgna is one who changed his view on the Fed and rate cuts over the weekend. He now expects a full point rate cut when the Fed announces its decision at 2:15 p.m. The only way I could see the Fed not going 100 (a full point) is if they accompany the 75 cut with their intention to purchase GSE debt, Fannie and Freddie debt, he said. Speaking of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the Wall Street Journal was reporting late Monday that the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight is close to reducing capital requirements for the two companies, a move that would give the firms more flexibility in buying mortgages. Look at the Feds action. They basically are telling you they are going to do something dramatic. I dont think 0.75 is particularly dramatic anymore. I think it has been priced into the market, he said. LaVorgna said the Feds statement will likely note that theres still downside risk. The Fed is not going to worry about inflation. Its going to worry about growth...were not out of the woods yet, he said. Market MayhemThe Dow finished 21 points higher at 11,972, after a nearly 200 point swoon. The Dow is now down 9.9 percent since the start of the year and 2.1 percent from a year ago. The Nasdaq though was bloodied in Mondays trading, scoring a 1.6 percent, or 35 point decline. Nasdaq is down 18 percent year-to-date and is off 9.1 percent in the past 52 weeks. The S&P 500 slipped 11 points to 1276, a level 13 percent below where it started the year. The Bear Stearns story ratcheted up anxiety about risk in the market, despite equities relatively tame reaction. Treasury yields fell as buyer moved into the safety of Treasurys. The 10-year was yielding 3.314 percent, and the yield on the two-year slipped to 1.333 percent, its lowest level since July, 2003. The dollar continued its weakening trend, losing 0.5 percent against the Euro  and 2 percent against the yen . Some of the real action though was in the commodities markets where sellers dumped energy, grains and metals (with the exception of gold). Gold finished at $1001.40 per troy ounce, up 0.3 percent.Crude oil  fell 4.1 percent to $105.68 a barrel. Gasoline fell 6.9 percent and natural gas fell 7.8 percent. Silver fell 1.7 percent, copper fell 3.5 percent. Soybeans, corn and wheat all fell sharply and sugar and coffee fell more than 10 percent. Joseph Terranova, partner at Thelogicaltrader.net, said commodities prices could get a lift from the Feds rate action Tuesday, but watch out Wednesday and Thursday. When market conditions get like they did this morning, you need to pare back and take a fresh look, said Terranova. He said its time to reduce some risk from portfolios, but investors should look to add to positions heading into the second quarter. He expects commodities to be flattish for a while. Im going to wait and see what Bernanke gives the street. Ill come back a week from today and well be putting stuff back in place ... But the oil story is not over, he said.

General Mills to release 10 boxes of marshmallow-only Lucky Charms#Tired of plucking all the marshmallows out of your Lucky Charms  cereal? Then this could be your lucky day.  General Mills is giving 10 people the chance to win a box of its  magically delicious cereal without the toasted oat pieces.

Despite what youve heard, annuities arent all bad#Its not just investment analyst Ken Fisher who hates annuities. On the list of financial products that fiduciary advisors love to bash, annuities — particularly variable annuities — are somewhere near the top.They are an easy target. The insurance contracts are expensive, difficult to understand (for both consumers and financial advisors), hard to get out of and arguably not in the interests of the millions of consumers who have bought them. Indeed, the sale of high-commission annuities has been flagged as one of the more egregious ways that financial advisors fail to act in their clients best interests.
Sears is working with Amazon to deliver and install car#Sears Holdings is taking its relationship with Amazon one step further. The department store chain announced Wednesday at its annual shareholders meeting in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, that it will offer full-service tire installation for orders from all tire brands on Amazon, including its own DieHard. News of the partnership sent Sears stock soaring as much as 22 percent in early trading. The shares were last up 24 percent.
Deal to avert government shutdown is pretty much done, Democratic#A deal between Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill to avert a government shutdown is pretty much done, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., told CNBC on Thursday.Theyre putting pen to paper, and its just a matter of how long it will take to get the deal kind of finalized, she said in an interview with Power Lunch.Earlier Thursday, Sen. Mitch McConnell said the Senate expects to pass a short-term funding bill ahead of the late Friday deadline to keep the government open.Heitkamp said after a couple of big concessions were made, the path for a deal become clear.Once … the Democrats were willing to do more on defense and the Republicans were willing to fulfill the commitment under the Affordable Care Act and not waste money throwing something at a border-security provision that wasnt actually going to enhance security — I think those were the two big things that needed to happen, she explained.On Wednesday, the Trump administration dropped its opposition to an Affordable Care Act subsidy for low-income people. The White House previously stopped insisting on funding for a wall on the southern border as part of a bill to keep the government funded.While the solution right now is expected to be a short-term extension, Heitkamp is optimistic about a long-term solution.If we didnt think that we were there with a negotiated deal, I dont think wed be agreeing on an extension. Its just a matter of getting the paperwork done so that all the ts are crossed and the is are dotted, she said.—CNBCs Jacob Pramuk contributed to this report.

Mike Pence saved the Republican party after that Cruz disaster#Ted Cruz essentially gave a career-ending  speech at the GOP convention on Wednesday night.   Cruzs speech was a slap in the face to GOP nominee Donald Trump.  This whole business about vote your conscience — thats a  wonderful-sounding phrase. But we all know what he meant: Dont  vote for Donald Trump.   I was in the convention hall and the crowds reaction was  unbelievable. It started out as a few hands waving in the air and  some booing and then it just grew and grew throughout the entire  convention hall. And then boom! It was absolute bedlam.  Ive been to most of the GOP conventions since 1980, and Ive  never seen anything like it. These people stood on their feet and  booed. These are Republicans! They dont do this. They dont know  how to stand up and boo! And yet, Cruz so divided them and worked  them into such a frenzy that it happened.  Cruz tried to pass it off as just the New York delegation acting  up. But that is wrong. The whole hall was in an uproar. You  couldnt even hear the last two paragraphs of Cruzs speech  because the booing had reached such a crescendo!  Cruz left an absolute disaster in his wake when he finished that  speech. Everyone was dispirited — as you might expect.  And then came Trump running mate Mike Pence.  Pence delivered a terrific speech. He touched on all the major  themes — the economy, shaking up Washington and Trump being  an outsider. He talked about how Trump understands that middle  class wage earners have been hurt — they havent had a raise  in 15 years. Thats something that Cruz, in all of his years of  political experience, still doesnt understand!
Small businesses that pulled outrageous publicity stunts#Anyone running a small business  knows that one of the most difficult challenges is effective  publicity. If people dont know the business exists, they wont  walk through the doors—and a business location, staff and  start-up capital become irrelevant points.  Publicity can be acquired with billboard space or TV commercials,  but many small businesses just dont have that kind of money. For  mom and pops, a little creativity and a flair for the theatrical  can go a long way. In short, they need to rely on good  old-fashioned, attention-grabbing publicity stunts.  Some businesses have seen stunts become catalysts that take them  to the next level. Others see efforts fizzle out, and in some  cases turn into horrific disasters. But while theres no  guarantee a publicity stunt will accomplish what its designed to  do, many businesses take that route anyway, always hoping for the  best.  Heres a list of businesses that engaged in noteworthy plays for  the publics attention. Some of these businesses used promotions  that exceeded expectations. Other businesses made headlines and  were soon forgotten, and others were unmitigated calamities. But  whatever the case, all these businesses deserve credit for trying  to do something a little different.  Read ahead to see our list of outrageous publicity stunts engaged  in by small businesses over the  years.By Daniel BukszpanUpdated 06 June 2013
100,000 march in Minsk to demand Belarus leader resigns#Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched Sunday to the outskirts of the presidential residence in the capital of Belarus, calling for the countrys authoritarian leader to resign as protests against President Alexander Lukashenko entered their fifth week.Protests also took place in major cities throughout Belarus, said Interior Ministry spokeswoman Olga Chemodanova. Crowd sizes for those protests were not immediately reported, but Ales Bialiatski, head of the Viasna human rights organization, said the demonstration in Minsk attracted more than 100,000 people.The protests, unprecedented in Belarus for their size and duration, began after the Aug. 9 presidential vote that election officials said gave Lukashenko a sixth term in office with 80% support. Protesters say the results were rigged, and some have explained to Associated Press journalists exactly how the fraud took place in their districts.Lukashenko has ruled the country with an iron fist since 1994, regularly repressing dissent and press freedom.Police violently cracked down on demonstrators in the first days of the protests, arresting some 7,000 people and beating hundreds. Although they have scaled back, detentions continue; Viasna reported scores of people were arrested in Minsk and in the city of Grodno on Sunday.Police and army troops blocked off the center of Minsk on Sunday, but demonstrators marched to the outskirts of the Palace of Independence, the presidents working residence 3 kilometers (2 miles) outside the city center. The palace grounds were blocked off by phalanxes of shield-bearing riot police and water cannon.This sea of ​​people cannot be stopped by military equipment, water cannons, propaganda and arrests. Most Belarusians want a peaceful change of power and we will not get tired of demanding this, said Maria Kolesnikova, a leader of the Coordination Council set up by the opposition to try to arrange a dialogue with the 66-year-old Lukashenko about a transition of power.She spoke with The Associated Press by telephone.Lukashenko has rejected any discussion with the council and some of its top members have been jailed. One of them, Olga Kovalova, was expelled from the country over the weekend, driven to Poland by police.Despite the stalemate between Lukashenko and the opposition, protesters say they are determined not to tire. Some of the placards they carried Sunday showed a lively sense of humor.
Former Obama speechwriter: This is the one question you have#Whether you are writing a presidential speech, sending a quick email to a colleague or getting your employees on board with a new initiative at work, the way you deliver your message can make or break the outcome.David Litt, former speechwriter for President Barack Obama, says there should be one question you think about as youre writing that email, planning your presentation or strategizing the team meeting:All communication boils down to: Whats the goal here? says Litt, who landed his job as a speechwriter at the White House at 24 years old.Too often people get into a room, everyones very eager, and they say, Okay, what do we say? rather than, What do we hope to accomplish with what were saying?
Draghi could leave investors in the dark with QE exit#The European Central Bank (ECB) is likely to hold off on making any announcements on its stimulus program when it meets this week, instead opting to push new developments to October in the face of a strong euro.President Mario Draghi said at the last ECB press conference that the Governing Council would discuss the future of its QE (quantitative easing) program in the fall - prompting many to speculate that he could detail a reduction of stimulus in September.However, with the fall technically only starting only at the end of September, these market participants may have gotten ahead of themselves.  The stronger euro could lead to such a heated debate that the ECB could postpone fall until the Indian summer period in late October, said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist for Germany and Austria at ING Diba, in a research note.Either way, the big question for this weeks meeting is whether Draghi will shed some light on the ECBs game plan for tapering, he added.
World’s Most Popular Business Cities#A shift in economic growth from the West to emerging markets over the past decade has led to the emergence of new business hubs across the world.Regions such as Asia, the Middle East and South America have seen rapid economic growth, coupled with improved infrastructure, and in some cases, lighter regulation. Multinational organizations have rushed to capitalize on this, increasing the number of people they hire in these countries and setting up new offices in emerging markets. For example, banks including HSBC and Barclays have said they will increase hiring in Asia, while cutting staff in developed markets. GE, for example, has moved the headquarters of its X-ray business to Beijing from the U.S.The emergence of these new business centers has sometimes come at the expense of the traditional centers such as New York, Frankfurt and London. But it hasnt always been smooth. Dubai, which experienced huge investments in real estate over the past decade, faced a property bust in 2009.We decided to look at the top business hubs in the world based on research by global real estate firm CB Richard Ellis, which surveyed 300 of the worlds largest companies, including Fortune 500 firms and other non-listed entities, such as law firms. The ranking is based on what percentage of these companies have offices in these cities.Weve matched that with the cost of renting office space in the central business districts (CBDs) of these hubs from real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield. Office rent cost is measured in square meter per year.The results might surprise you with some of the largest North American cities absent. So which cities are the worlds most popular business hubs?

White House considers tax cuts, extra Fed pressure in coronavirus#Trump administration officials are considering a tax cut package as part of the White Houses economic response to the coronavirus outbreak, The Washington Post reported Friday, citing five people with knowledge of the planning.Those people also discussed whether the White House should ramp up pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, according to the Post.Fears about the spread of the deadly virus have sent the stock market spiraling downward in recent trading sessions.Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in a note Friday that the central bank is monitoring the coronavirus for risks it poses to the U.S. economy and pledged it would take action if necessary. He offered no specifics on whether the Fed was considering a rate cut.Vice President Mike Pences office is involved in the discussions about the possible economic responses to the coronavirus, according to the Post.The White House didnt immediately respond to CNBCs request for comment.The newspaper reported that the economic proposals were not intended to stop the spread of the virus, but rather to ease the economic fears that have gripped global markets.The administrations ideas for an economic response are in the early stages, the Post reported.White House officials, including President Donald Trump himself, have worked to inject some calm into the economy, which is in the midst of a massive sell-off.The fast-spreading disease has killed more than 2,800 people around the world and infected more than 83,000. But only 61 cases have been confirmed in the U.S., and no U.S. deaths have been reported.National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said in a television interview Friday that investors should not rule out more optimistic options.Stocks look pretty cheap to me, Kudlow added.Read the full report from The Washington Post.
Greenberg: Momentum King’s Next Big Move#Over the years, when the market has gotten really wacky, tense and emotional, I have tended to always check in with the king of momentum investing: William O’Neil — or at least his organization, which includes Investors Business Daily. I’ve actually never talked to O’Neil, but I’ve often been surprised to hear they were long gone from (or certainly cautious on) some of the biggest momentum names when the market — or at least a cluster of names — has appeared to have gotten out of control. That’s when companies go from being just companies to being stocks. With that in mind, what’s the current state of momentum? Depends when you ask. “The first thing we always look at is the direction of the market, and it’s unclear at this point.” Chris Gessel, executive editor of IBD, has worked with O’Neil for 15 years and serves as the front man to people like me. We were talking late Tuesday morning — and at that point he was saying: Enter later in the afternoon, after the market closed. I checked back with Gessel and (surprise!) he had an update – proving just how unpredictable this market has become: “We’re changing our outlook back to an uptrend because of the action of the leaders,” he said. Does that mean the choppy and unclear nature of the market — with indexes in conflict with the leaders — is moot? “It’s not entirely resolved” Gessel said. “But the leaders are acting very well and the market is okay. Today’s positive reversal and close right near the high after last week’s positive action is getting hard to ignore.” What about the hottest stocks? Some of the big movers like Netflix, OpenTable, Chipotle and Apple are at points where Gessel says the O’Neil model might not commit new money “at this point.” (It tends to wait for the stock to start moving again with confirming volume.) The big easier gains have passed and a lot more diligence and disciplined trading is required. You need to buy at the right point. On the other hand, AthenaHealthis starting to show up on the O’Neil radar, thanks to accelerating sales and earnings. “It’s a fairly new stock for us,” Gessel says. “But it had been going sideways for four years.” Even though it’s nearly double its summer lows, Gesssel says, “You wouldn’t look at this and call this a momentum stock.” Not yet, at least. My take: Never forget the part about growth stocks and their exaggerated ties to the market. The markets may come and go but that never changes – both ways! Questions? Comments?

Ex-sector ETFs offer new way to bet on stocks#Ill take the S&P, but hold the energy.  A new set of exchange-traded funds offered by ProShares allows investors to get exposure to the entire , save for one or another given  sector. Specifically, the company now offers ETFs tracking the  S&P 500 ex-energy (trading under the ticker symbol SPXE), ex-financials  (SPXN), ex-health  care (SPXV) and  ex-technology (SPXT).   In a Thursday interview with CNBCs Trading Nation, ProShares head of  investment strategy, Simeon Hyman, highlighted two anticipated uses  for the ETFs: diversification and tactical decision-making.  Hyman provides the example of an investor who already has high  exposure to a given sector—such as an executive compensated  in a companys stock, or an inheritor who has received a large  number of shares—and does not want to take on excess  exposure.  Previously youd have to maybe call up a trust company or find  someone to run a custom strategy for you to avoid that sector,  and here its just very straightforward: Buy an ETF. The sectors  out, its redistributed across the other names on a  market-cap-weighted basis, you dont have to worry about it,  Hyman said.   Second, the ETFs are designed for those who believe a given  sector, such as energy, is set to underperform the rest of the  market. If you have that conviction, this is a very  straightforward and easy way to effect that view, he said. Read More  Stocks setting up for big upside reversal: Technician
What to Expect From Apple: Analyst#For its stock to perform once again, Apple needs to provide investors with some level of  confidence in its future, BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk said  Tuesday.  Im a little surprised by the lack of capital allocation, he  said. A lot of people were expecting something to happen in  March, and when it didnt, then the fear started to creep in.  On CNBCs Fast Money, Piecyk  issued a buy rating for Apple on March 14 with a price target  of $540 per share.  Piecyk said that the upgrade was based on a belief that Apple was  en route to grow its earnings nominally.  Theyve got all these people staring at these screens on their  iPhones, and theres a lot of ways to monetize that, whether its  through payment systems or ecommerce, he said.  I think the problem with Apple right now is people are just  questioning whether they can ever return to growth, whether they  had a peak earnings year last year that theyll never get back  to. If you can just return some level of confidence that they can  return to growth, then the stock will do very well, very  quickly.  Piecyk took a balanced view of Apples performance.  What were looking for is a bad March quarter, frankly, thats  below where the consensus is now, even though youve had massive  cuts continually. Every week, youve got a different cut, he  said. But more importantly, the June guide is the real risk  here, and that June guide is going to be a down revenue quarter,  perhaps earnings under 8. Consensus is still over 9 for earnings  for the June quarter.

Analysts See Subprime Losses Reaching $400 Billion#Banks worldwide may lose as much as $400 billion from subprime mortgages, as at least one in four of the risky home loans go into default, analysts said on Monday. Mike Mayo, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities, estimated $150 billion to $250 billion of losses based on $1.2 trillion of U.S. subprime loans, and an additional $150 billion of losses on derivatives linked to subprime debt. David Hilder, a Bear Stearns analyst, also estimated a $150 billion to $250 billion loss on subprime home loans, in what he called a $2 trillion market. Given our fundamental outlook, which is for rising inflows of non-performing loans in both mortgage and commercial loan portfolios, we believe the odds are in favor of the write-downs getting worse, rather than better, this year, Hilder wrote. Banks including Citigroup,Merrill Lynch and Wachovia have announced more than $40 billion of write-offs this year as U.S. foreclosures set records and after investors stopped buying many kinds of risky debt. Mayo said large banks and brokerages may suffer $100 billion to $130 billion of the subprime losses. He said this could include $60 billion to $70 billion by year end, including $43 billion already reported. In the fourth quarter alone, he said Barclays, HSBC Holdings, Royal Bank of Scotland Group and UBS might each need to write off $5 billion, while Merrill Lynch might write off $4 billion and Bank of America Corp $1 billion. Mayos forecast assumes a 30 percent to 40 percent default rate and 40 percent to 50 percent loss rate. Hilder assumes a 25 percent to 30 percent default rate and 30 percent to 40 percent loss rate.
Bloomberg botches tax return question in Democratic debate: I cant#WASHINGTON – Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg stumbled in Wednesday nights Democratic debate in response to a question about when he planned to release his tax returns.It just takes us a long time, Bloomberg said.Unfortunately, or fortunately, I make a lot of money and we do business all around the world, and we are preparing it. The number of pages will probably be thousands of pages. I cant go to TurboTax, Bloomberg added.The remarks, which gave the impression that he was bragging about his wealth, drew boos from the audience in Las Vegas. Nevada holds its Democratic caucus on Saturday. He was already taking a beating from his rivals, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.But I put out my tax return every year for 12 years in City Hall, he said. We will put out this one, it tells everybody everything they need to know about every investment that I make and where the money goes and the biggest item is all the money I give away.Bloomberg is the wealthiest candidate in modern times to mount a viable campaign for president, and has so far spent more than $400 million of his own fortune on ads, despite not appearing on any ballots so far. He is worth about $60 billion.But the question of his taxes is one that could haunt Bloomberg if he were to be the Democratic nominee in a general election. President Donald Trump long vowed to release his tax returns, but has yet to do so, claiming that he is under a constant state of audit that prevents him from making the returns public.In 2016 Trump was the first major party candidate in nearly 50 years not to release tax returns to the public.

Islamic financing package supports development of wind farm in Jordan#The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has set up a financing package to fund the construction of a wind farm in Jordan, it announced Tuesday.   The package, of up to $80 million, will support the 51.75-megawatt (MW) Arbour Wind Farm in the south of the country. The facility is being built by the Abour Energy Company, a joint venture between Xenel International and AMEA Power.   A development institution that focuses on the private sector in emerging markets, the IFC is a sister organization of the World Bank and a member of the World Bank Group.   To date, it has invested over $300 million in Jordan to support clean energy. The financing package for the Arbour facility is made up of a $28 million loan for the IFCs own account and mobilized parallel loans from the Islamic Development Bank.   Jordans energy sector has been on a steady path of reform, Mouayed Makhlouf, the IFCs director for the Middle East and North Africa, said in a statement Tuesday. Supporting renewable energy projects and opening the sector to private investments is a pillar of our work in Jordan and the region, Makhlouf added.   The IFC said it had structured the deal in the form of an Islamic finance Ijara transaction. According to the World Bank, an Ijara transaction involves a bank purchasing an asset on behalf of a client, and then allowing use of that asset for a fixed rental fee.   The Bank adds that ownership of the asset remains with the financier but may gradually transfer to the client who eventually becomes the owner.   The director general of Jordans National Electric Power Company, Amjad Rawashdeh, said in a statement Tuesday that its focus was on continuing to diversify energy sources. IFCs work and investment has been crucial in helping the development of... renewables in the country, Rawashdeh added.   In April, GE Renewable Energy announced it would provide turbines for the development of a 100 MW wind farm in Jordan. The Mass Wind project is due to be operational by the end of 2019 and will meet the power needs of more than 150,000 homes.

JPMorgan tops investment bank table again, top five all US#JPMorgan retained its place at the top of the global  investment bank rankings in the first half of this year despite a  fall in revenues, while Deutsche Banks troubles  ensured the top five were all U.S. banks, new data on Friday  showed.JPMorgans revenue from trading, mergers and acquisitions and  other investment banking activity was $12.5 billion in the six  months to June, down 5.3 percent from the same period a year ago,  according to data compiled by industry analytics firm Coalition.Deutsche has warned it may need deeper cost cuts to turn itself  around after revenue fell sharply in the second quarter due to  challenging markets and low interest rates. It fell to sixth  place from third, allowing Bank of America Merrill Lynch to move up into the top five.

Banking stem cells in the hope of a lifesaving cure#Forget about cash—start banking your body.  Using a technology that echoes science fiction movies, a French company is offering people a bank to store  their own stem cells for years in a bet that those cells may be used to grow replacement organs and possibly  save their lives someday.  Its a personal deposit of your cell, said Dr. André  Choulika, CEO of the biotech company Cellectis, which  is launching the stem-cell bank known  as Scéil this month.  Given the rate of developments in stem-cell research and their  potential for curbing health costs, Choulika thinks  Scéils model of creating and storing stem cells one day  will become so cheap that it will become mandatory for people  with medical insurance.  This pace of science currently goes so fast, probably in a few  years, less than 10 years, everyone will have their own cell  backup, and it will be a requirement, said Choulika, whose  company is named after the Gaelic word for story, and is  pronounced sail by Choulika.   We believe that regenerative medicine is the future, he   said.   In the present, though, it is anything but  cheap. Scéils services cost $60,000, Choulika said,  adding that it is a one-time payment, for your life.  (Read more: Hot biotech  IPOs)  Choulika said he expects enthusiastic adoption by wealthy  clients, as has been seen with other new technologies.  Then, system improvements and competition could drive the  initial price down considerably.  Its expensive, or it seems expensive, for one reason, Choulika  said. We dont know how many people are going to sign up,  and its a very complex and sophisticated technology, he said. The number of people now who could both afford the  process and be interested in trying it might top 1 million.
Fitch cuts Turkey rating outlook to negative in wake of#Ratings agency Fitch affirmed its sovereign rating on Turkey at  BBB-, the lowest investment grade, on Friday but lowered its outlook to negative from stable in a review after last  months attempted military coup.   Investors have been rattled by both the failed July 15 putsch,  when a group of rogue soldiers attempted to overthrow the  government, and the widespread crackdown that has followed, with  the arrests or dismissals of tens of thousands of people.    An unsuccessful coup attempt in July confirms heightened risks  to political stability, the Fitch statement said, saying a purge  of some 70,000 public sector workers generates uncertainty over  capacity and continuity.   Political uncertainty is expected to impact economic performance  and poses risks to economic policy, it added.    Both Fitch and Moodys rate Turkey at the lowest investment-grade  rung, allowing its bonds to be bought by more conservative funds  that require a country to be classed as investment grade by at  least two agencies.    Moodys said on July 18 it was putting Turkeys credit rating on  review for a possible downgrade to junk status.   Standard & Poors cut its unsolicited rating on Turkey  further into junk territory last month and changed its outlook to  negative, also citing concerns following the coup.   In Fridays statement, Fitch said the overwhelming public  opposition to the coup attempt and subsequent unity of most  political parties could lessen political fractures.   But security conditions have worsened, it said, referring to  militant attacks which it said were having a material impact on  the tourism sector.     It did not expect the fiscal stance to weaken in response to the  coup attempt, though the central bank and commercial banks are  facing renewed political pressure on interest rates, it  said.   A downgrade could be triggered by prolonged or deepened political  instability, insecurity or geopolitical stresses that undermine  economic performance or economic policy credibility, it  added.
Biden ramps up Latino outreach with appeal to Puerto Rican#WASHINGTON – Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden visited South Florida on Tuesday, seeking to shore up support among Hispanic voters in this crucial swing state.Bidens trip came after a poll of Florida voters was released last week that sent shockwaves through the Democratic Party. The poll, by NBC News and Marist, found President Donald Trump leading Biden among Latino voters by four points, 50-46.Four years ago, Democrat Hillary Clinton won Hispanic voters in Florida by 25 points, 60-35, although she lost the state overall. According to the NBC poll, Biden is underperforming Clinton by 29 points with a key demographic in a key state.Historically, Republicans tend to do better with Hispanic voters in Florida than they do elsewhere, owing to the states large concentration of Cuban Americans who lean Republican.Nonetheless, the NBC survey results coming just 50 days before Election Day set off alarm bells at the Biden campaign.On Saturday, the Biden campaign unveiled a trio of new Spanish-language ads that will run in Florida, each one directed at a specific group of Hispanic voters.On Sunday, aides to billionaire Michael Bloomberg announced that the former Democratic primary candidate will spend $100 million to support Biden in Florida, essentially freeing up the campaign to put money allocated for Florida into other battleground states such as Pennsylvania.Tuesday night was Bidens first major speech aimed directly at Hispanic voters in Florida. But not just any Hispanic voters: Puerto Rican voters.
JD.com wants a network of 5 million stores as e-commerce#Chinese retailer JD.com plans to aggressively expand its brick-and-mortar reach— aiming for a network of 5 million physical stores in the next 3 years — as Chinas e-commerce companies sharpen their competition for consumers in smaller Chinese cities.Xu Lei, chief executive of JD Retail, said the company is aware that Chinas retail market is huge. But he added that JDs business model can have limitations and he therefore wants to build offline stores on our own and partner with existing players.

EU prolongs until September blacklist of Russians over Ukraine crisis#The European Union has prolonged for six months until Sept. 15 a blacklist of Russian and Crimean individuals and firms accused of undermining Ukraines integrity and independence, an EU statement said on Monday.The assessment of the situation did not justify a change in the sanctions regime, the statement said. The sanctions were introduced in March 2014 following Russias annexation of Crimea and its involvement in the revolt in eastern Ukraine.The list includes advisers and aides of President Vladimir Putin, parliamentarians, defense and intelligence officials, army and navy commanders, as well as Crimean separatists and rebels in east Ukraine.Two people were removed from the list because they have recently died, the statement said. The updated list covers 150 persons and 37 companies which remain subject to visa bans and an asset freeze in the EU.
Investors on pace to plow a record amount of money#Investors are barreling toward the bond market as inflows look to break a new monthly record.Inflows to U.S. high-grade funds and exchange-traded funds have averaged $846 million per day in March, ahead of the $800 million average during the record month last year, according to research from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.The previous record for corporate bond inflows was $38.4 billion in January 2018.Based on daily fund and ETF inflows, March is on track to set a new monthly record, Bank of America credit strategists Yuri Seliger and Yunyi Zhang wrote Wednesday.Inflows this year have been delayed relative to earlier periods of strong bond price appreciation, the strategists added. Given the more stable macro conditions currently flows catching up to the historical trend could provide another catalyst for stronger inflows.The iShares iBoxx Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, just one of many such funds, has alone seen inflows of more than $600 million in the past month and about $440 million since the start of March.The pivot into investment-grade debt comes as a growing number of economists and investors believe the U.S. economy is poised for a slowdown in the next year. Yields of ranging quality have been under pressure ever since the Federal Reserve downgraded its forecast for the American economy last week, when it decided to leave its overnight lending rate unchanged.Some investors may view corporate debt as a somewhat safer bet over a volatile equity market despite sharp gains in the S&P 500 this year. Though the broad, large-cap index is up more than 11 percent this year, fund flows have not kept pace. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF, one of the largest in the world with over $260 billion under management, has seen outflows of more than $10 billion since the year began.Data arriving since September suggest that growth is slowing somewhat more than expected, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said last week. While the U.S. economy showed little evidence of slowdown through the end of 2018, the limited data we have so far this year have been somewhat more mixed.The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note is down more than 25 basis points since last Monday, falling under the rate on the 3-month Treasury bill. On the corporate side, companies in the U.S. have taken advantage of low interest rates both to grow business and reward shareholders, ballooning their own debt sums.Flows follow returns and the drop in interest rates since Monday of last week should encourage potentially even stronger inflows in April, Seliger and Zhang added.While companies have thus far been able to find buyers for their debt, many market participants are keeping a close eye for changes in the economy and confidence. Both February payrolls data and March consumer confidence disappointed investors recently, pressuring investors out of equities and into safer markets like debt.Total corporate debt has swelled from nearly $4.9 trillion in 2007 as the Great Recession was just starting to break out to nearly $9.1 trillion halfway through 2018, quietly surging 86 percent, according to Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association data.

Forget the Brexit noise, these are the real risks Europe#The political and economic noise created by the U.K.s decision  to leave the European Union is masking a large number of risks  in Europe, according to the regions political experts.A large number of material political risks in southern and core  Europe are being masked by the noise emanating from Brexit,  Mujtaba Rahman, managing director of Europe at political risk  consultancy Eurasia Group, said in a note Thursday.He and his team were not alone, with other political risk  consultancies remarking on the fact that Brexit could in fact be  the least of Europes worries. Heres CNBCs collection of  Europes top ten upcoming risk events, according to analysts.
Peloton shares rise as treadmill recall impact not as bad#Peloton shares climbed more than 9% Friday as investors realized the financial hit from the companys treadmill recall isnt as bad as some had feared.The exercise equipment maker said demand for its high-end cycles remains strong, despite people increasingly breaking free of stay-at-home routines and gyms seeing pandemic restrictions ease.Peloton is also still planning to launch in Australia later this year, and is ramping up marketing spending to try to reach new customers.While the recall will hit financials in the short term, and push back Tread financials a quarter or two, we think this was the prudent decision in the long term, Barclays analyst Mario Lu said in a note to clients. We continue to view Peloton as the leading company in connected digital fitness.When Peloton reported its fiscal third-quarter results on Thursday, it said fourth-quarter sales will be $165 million lower due to the recall. That puts fourth-quarter revenue at about $915 million, short of analysts estimates for $1.12 billion, according to Refinitiv data.The projected $165 million impact consists of a roughly $105 million dent from a lack of treadmills sales during the period, since all sales are halted, Peloton said. The company is also assuming about 10% of current treadmill owners will ask for a refund for their machines, which cost $4,300 apiece, and that would lower sales by an additional $50 million.Telsey Advisory Group analyst Dana Telsey had expected the recall to have a larger impact. She maintained her outperform rating on stock, but lowered her price target to $120 from $150, due to uncertainty around the ultimate financial impact of the recalls and on Pelotons brand name.She noted, though, that demand for Pelotons Bike and Bike+ machines is still solid. And the more expensive fix will be for Pelotons Tread+ machine, rather than the less expensive Tread version, which represents a much smaller revenue stream overall, Telsey said.Peloton shares closed Thursday at $83.78. The stock is down about 45% year to date, bringing the companys market cap to about $24 billion. Shares had tumbled nearly 15% on Wednesday, the day the company announced its voluntary recall, wiping $4.1 billion from Pelotons market value.On a call, Chief Executive John Foley walked through the steps the company is taking with the U.S. Consumer Protection Safety Commission to launch the Tread in the United States later this year. It had been scheduled for May 27, but is being pushed back until Peloton and the CPSC can work on new safety protocols.That could potentially happen as early as July, Foley said.According to Telsey, thats also earlier than many people were anticipating.Somewhat lost amidst the Tread/+ recalls discussion was a very strong third quarter, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth said. Peloton beat across all metrics.—CNBCs Michael Bloom contributed to this reporting.

Luxury Motorbike Sales Accelerate in India#Every day India’s cities hum with the sound of hundreds of motorcycles precariously weaving their way through traffic. For most riders the two-wheeler is the cheaper and more flexible alternative to a car but for a growing band of more affluent Indians owning a customised superbike has become the ultimate symbol of the country’s new-found wealth.
Traders on which travel stock they’re backing as Expedia reports#Expedia fell in extended trading Thursday after its quarterly release.The online travel booking site posted a 67% drop in revenue to $920 million in the three months to December, below analysts estimates for more than $1 billion. A loss of $2.64 a share was wider than an expected $1.94.The company blazed into its earnings in comeback mode, though. The stock had rallied 268% from its March low, hitting its highest level since 2017 on Thursday, even with the travel industry still struggling amid the coronavirus pandemic.But, that performance still pales in comparison to Airbnb. Since going public on Dec. 10, that stock has surged more than 200%. Airbnbs market cap of $130 billion is larger than all the other online travel booking sites including Expedia, Booking and TripAdvisor.Katie Stockton, founder of Fairlead Strategies, broke down the Airbnb chart for CNBCs Trading Nation on Thursday.Its in an intermediate-term uptrend already just with history back to December, and with limited price history we dont really have any ways to discern how overbought the stock is, but there are no real signs of upside exhaustion as we come into [Airbnb] earnings, she said.Airbnb is scheduled to report earnings on Feb. 25 for the first time as a publicly traded company. While Airbnb has benefited from a consumer preference for vacation rentals over hotel chains during the pandemic, it has still suffered from lockdowns – analysts surveyed by FactSet anticipate a net loss of $8.42 a share for its December-ended quarter.If you look at Expedia on the other hand, that uptrend still very much has positive momentum across time horizons and Im not really one to fight that. But what I would say is that the risk reward is not great from a technical perspective, Stockton said.She highlights a band of support at $135 and resistance at $161, level with its 2017 high. The stock closed at $149.91 on Thursday.That creates a bad imbalance between the downside and upside potential here in terms of those levels so I dont think its very compelling especially with the broader market showing some signs of short-term upside exhaustion, she said.
20 Stocks With the Potential to Drop (Q1 2012)#Its the basic question when investing in a stock: is it on the way up or down? The street has developed numerous ways of attempting to predict what will happen, estimating various attributes tied to stock performance in order to determine what the future holds for a companys valuation.

Gold slides as upbeat US economic data lifts dollar#Gold slipped on Wednesday, adding to its deepest monthly losses  in over three years as strong U.S. economic data buoyed the  dollar and further cemented the case for hiking rates in  December.    U.S. private employers stepped up hiring in November much  more than expected and consumer spending increased last month,  giving more ammunition to the Federal Reserve for a rate  increase.     The data helped the dollar climb half a percent against a  basket of major currencies after last week touching the highest  levels for almost 14 years.                Gold is highly sensitive to rising rates, which lift the  opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion,  while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced.  Spot gold had dropped 1.1 percent to  $1,174.96 an ounce by 3:06 p.m. EDT while U.S. gold  future for December delivery settled at $1,170.80.  Gold has shed nearly 8 percent in November, the biggest monthly fall since June 2013, hurt by a rally in the U.S.  dollar on surging Treasury yields as investors believed  President-elect Donald Trumps policies would invoke faster inflation.
With a Triple Crown possible, TV viewership could surge#The stakes are high for this Saturdays 150th running of the Belmont Stakes — and not just for Justify, the undefeated horse that may ride take the Triple Crown, something only 12 horses have ever managed to do. The average television viewership for the last three non-Triple Crown races was about 5.9 million, according to NBC Sports Group, which owns the broadcast rights. Compare that with 19.6 million, the average number of viewers in 2014 and 2015 when a Triple Crown was a possibility. The Triple Crown is the very elusive title given to a 3-year-old thoroughbred horse that manages to win three races: The Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes. Saturdays race is being held at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York.If Justify wins it will be No. 13. In May, the colt won the 144th Kentucky Derby by 2½ lengths in just more than 2 minutes. Justify also won the Preakness Stakes in May by a half-length. Bob Baffert, the legendary horse trainer who won the Triple Crown in 2015 with the horse American Pharoah, and who also trains Justify, can still remember the intensity of when American Pharoah won. Its that kind of electricity in the air, when youre so glad you were there and part of it, Baffert said Wednesday on Squawk on the Street.Thats why everybody goes out there, he said. Thats why itll be packed, because you want to feel that excitement.
Three ways to jump-start job growth#The economy is off to a rocky start in 2016. Investors and analysts are unhappy. But while many analysts focus on jittery stock markets and bad news from overseas, there is a disheartening trend right before our eyes that almost no one is paying attention to: The high-growth, young companies that have traditionally driven job growth and innovation in our country are a dying breed. For the past several decades, business start-ups have steadily declined in America.    Have people become less ambitious? Less innovative? Thats unlikely. A more probable explanation is that a steady accrual of rules and regulations for years has effectively eliminated a generation of entrepreneurs as the costs of running a new enterprise outweigh the benefits. The good news is that there is an antidote: increasing economic freedom.   But first, lets look at the scope of the problem.  New and young businesses have historically been the heart of the U.S. economy. They are responsible for nearly all the new jobs we produce each year. And yet a growing body of research shows that young businesses have been on the decline in the U.S. since the 1980s, which means we have far fewer jobs available today than if businesses were still starting at the 1980s rate.   Even more alarming:  The share of high-growth young companies has collapsed, a new National Bureau of Economic Research study reports. The authors show that, historically, most job growth among young businesses has come from a small percentage of them that are growing much faster than all the others. Since 1999, this fast-growing cohort has essentially vanished, and young businesses are now more likely to be characterized as no-growth or slow-growth.  In other words, the dynamism most of us associate with the U.S. economys ability to create jobs and foster innovation through new enterprises is evaporating before our eyes.   Imagine if a steady stream of research showed an alarming spike in life-threatening diseases caused by additives in our food that had been weakening our immune systems. We would be doing everything we could as a society to understand and remove these debilitating additives from our food.  Despite a growing body of evidence that declining entrepreneurial dynamism is weakening our economy, policy makers have done little to understand the additives in our economy that are creating the problem. For help, they might start with the Fraser Institutes annual Economic Freedom of North America report.  The latest report finds that states with more stringent labor laws, business start-up costs, licensing laws, and compliance costs — to name a few —  perform worse than more economically free states. Per capita income in the most free states is 14 percent higher than in the most un-free states.   Undaunted, however, regulators continue to pump harmful additives into our economy. Regulations implemented over the past seven years alone amount to a $100 billion tax on the economy. One estimate finds that 31 percent of regulations increase compliance costs without providing any real health or safety benefit.  The well-documented explosion in state licensing laws over the past generation has kept an untold number of entrepreneurs from entering the marketplace in the first place. It is no wonder that small business owners now rank regulations on par with taxes as the single biggest threat to their growth, more than the cost of health insurance or competition with big businesses.  Policy makers should pursue three courses of action to liberate would-be entrepreneurs from the tangled web of rules that hold them back. First, Congress should enact legislation requiring congressional approval of all federal regulations estimated to have an impact above a certain dollar amount, such as $100 million. Congress bad habit of delegating rule-making authority to unelected officials in federal agencies is a big reason we have had an explosion in costly, complicated rules.  Second, Congress should enact a cap on the number and dollar amount of regulatory requirements every year. There are several ways to do this such as eliminating old regulations for each new, proposed regulation or capping the overall cost of regulations each year. Canada recently passed legislation capping their annual regulatory activity. The United States should do the same.  Third, state-level policy makers should provide alternatives to professional licensing, such as allowing individuals to opt out of licensing requirements in favor of nationally recognized, self-certification registries that rely on the tools of accountability and trust at the heart of the sharing economy. Too many professions have begun behaving like cartels behind the guise of licensing requirements. It is past time to break them up.  We hear a lot in our public discourse about inequality, but we hear far too little about our declining entrepreneurial dynamism. What if the latter is driving the former? It is certainly clear that starting a new business is not the path to upward mobility that it once was for middle class families.   The trend of declining business start-ups has worsened to the point that our children may never know the range of opportunity Americans, until recently, took for granted. It is time for our policy makers to follow the data and embrace economic freedom over the rules and regulations that are discouraging would-be entrepreneurs from getting in the game.

Want to start a business? Heres what you need to#Local retailers around the country are hoping the biggest  shopping day of the holiday season wont end up being Black  Friday, but the day after—whats known as Small Business  Saturday.  About 3,000 neighborhoods already have signed up to support the  day, which resulted in about $5.7 billion in consumer spending  with independent merchants last year, according to data from  American Express. Entrepreneurs—both established and aspiring—are  eager to capitalize on this interest. But opening your own  bakery, clothing boutique or furniture store can be a daunting task  without the passion and perseverance to weather the ups and  downs.
Bidens national polling lead shrinks slightly, but swing states show#Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is still leading President Donald Trump in the polls, though averages of national surveys show a trend toward a slightly tightening race with less than seven weeks until Election Day. But Biden continues to hold his edge over the incumbent in a handful of crucial swing states, including some that Trump won in 2016.Individual polls of the race for the White House show a much wider variance. National surveys released this week from The Economist/YouGov and Reuters/Ipsos both put Biden up 9 points on Trump among likely voters. But Rasmussen — the presidents favorite pollster, which has consistently found higher levels of support for him than other outfits — on Wednesday gave Trump his first-ever polling lead over Biden, by 1 point, which falls within its margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.
Update: Meaningful Breakout In Market?#Despite chatter last week that the market was overbought, again the bulls pushed the S&P 500 even higher on Monday after solid earnings combined with a flurry of merger news boosted investor appetite for equities.Take a look at some of the big deals that went down:Company               Target                        IndustryDanaher Corp.       Beckman Coulter       Medical DevicesEnsco                  Pride International     Offshore DrillingAOL                     Huffington Post         MediaInvestors take the deal activity to mean Corporate America views stock valuations as attractive.

Qualcomm should consider breakup: Jana Partners founder#Activist investor Jana Partners has held constructive  discussions with Qualcomm about potentially spinning off its chip  unit from its patent-licensing business, Jana founder and  managing partner Barry Rosenstein said on Monday.  We are convinced that the board and the management recognize  their issues. We are convinced that theyre trying to do the  right thing, and were optimistic that theyre going to, he said  during an interview on CNBCs Squawk on the Street.  Rosenstein emphasized that Jana is only asking Qualcomm to  consider a spinoff at this point.   What we think they ought to do is just a transparent review of  the client businesses, and determine whether or not it makes  sense to do either a partial or full split. So we are not  definitely saying that they should split it up, he said. Read MoreWhy rise of activist investors is bad  for bonds The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that Jana had  addressed the possible split as a means of boosting the  chipmakers sagging stock price, citing a quarterly letter that  will be sent to Jana investors on Monday.  Shares of Qualcomm, which has a market capitalization of $115.4  billion, have fallen about 6 percent since the beginning of this  year. The stock was trading nearly 1 percent higher on  Monday.  Jana, one of Qualcomms largest shareholders, is also calling on  the company to cut costs, accelerate stock buybacks and make  changes to its executive pay structure, financial reporting and  board of directors, the newspaper said.  Qualcomm said last month it would buy back up to $15 billion of  shares and raise its quarterly dividend. The company also said it  would continue to return at least 75 percent of its free cash  flow to shareholders annually.  Rosenstein acknowledged that Qualcomm has already announced a $10  billion advanced share repurchase, but said he believed the  company could return an additional $5 billion within four to six  months.

U.S. Foreign Service group blasts State Departments plans for large#As Covid-19 surges across the country, the American Foreign Service Association on Friday criticized large indoor holiday events scheduled at the U.S. State Department.AFSA, whose members include active-duty and retired Foreign Service officers and specialists at the State Department and other federal agencies, said in a statement that it is very concerned to see reports of plans to host holiday parties with hundreds of invitees at the Department of State.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other State Department officials have planned several indoor holiday parties, including one with at least 900 guests invited, The Washington Post reported.The scheduled events fly in the face of a Nov. 25 notice from State Department leadership that instructed employees to avoid hosting non-mission critical events in person and opt for virtual events, NBC News reported.We urge the Department to reverse course and model responsible behavior in accordance with its own guidelines, AFSA said.Weve taken every precaution to thin out the number of individuals in all spaces at one time, and plan to keep outdoors space open and available to attendees, weather permitting, a State Department spokesperson said in an email in response to AFSAs statement, adding that the department plans to follow health precautions including requiring masks, social distancing and temperature checks.The spokesperson did not provide guidance on how the State Department will enforce mask-wearing while food and beverages are provided at the events.The Centers for Disease Control cautions against indoor gatherings, which it says poses more risk of coronavirus spread than outdoor gatherings.The White House also plans to host at least 20 indoor holiday parties, according to NBC News, including one held Tuesday night featuring an appearance from President Donald Trump. Pictures from the event show several attendees not wearing masks.Several White House events, including the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett and an election night celebration, have resulted in dozens of coronavirus cases. In all, at least 45 people connected to the White House, including Trump, first lady Melania Trump and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows have tested positive for the virus.When asked during a press conference Wednesday whether the White House is setting a good example for Americans by hosting in-person holiday parties, press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said, You can celebrate the holiday of Christmas, and you can do it responsibly...We will engage in the celebration of Christmas. McEnany tested positive for Covid-19 in October.A report from the White Houses own coronavirus task force obtained by NBC News on Wednesday warned the COVID risk to all Americans is at a historic high.The report urged Americans to avoid social gatherings and said, It must be made clear that if you are over 65 or have significant health conditions, you should not enter any indoor public spaces where anyone is unmasked due to the immediate risk to your health.The U.S. reported a record number of daily new Covid-19 cases, current hospitalizations and single-day deaths on Thursday, indicating that the national virus crisis is only accelerating.
Twitter suspends fake accounts posing as Black Trump supporters#Twitter has suspended a group of fake accounts pretending to be owned by Black supporters of President Donald Trump and his re-election campaign.The micro-blogging platform said Tuesday the accounts breached its policies on spam and platform manipulation. The news was first reported by The Washington Post.Multiple fake accounts posted the same bogus language including the phrase: YES IM BLACK AND IM VOTING FOR TRUMP!!!Darren Linvill, an associate professor studying social media disinformation at Clemson University, worked with journalists at The Post on the story. He wrote on Twitter that trolls are out there trying to influence our conversations before November.Offending accounts appeared to use stolen photos of real people including military veterans and members of law enforcement in their profile pictures.Collectively, the accounts had 265,000 retweets or Twitter mentions. Some of them had amassed over 10,000 followers.Linvill told Reuters that most of the accounts were set up in 2017 and that they had become more active in the last couple of months.A Twitter spokesperson told CNBC: Our teams are working diligently to investigate this activity and will take action in line with the Twitter Rules if Tweets are found to be in violation. Presently, weve taken action on some Tweets and accounts for violations of our policies on platform manipulation and spam.Twitter is yet to say how many accounts it has suspended or who is behind them.Twitter writes on its website that it does not allow users to to artificially amplify or suppress information or engage in behavior that manipulates or disrupts peoples experience on Twitter.
Job Seekers: 3 Things To Do Now#We all get choices that take us in completely different directions: career in one industry v. another; entrepreneur v. employee; stay-at-home parent v. career outside the home. These decisions encompass so many variables that it is hard to consider each tradeoff on its own (i.e., compensation, career growth, work/life balance). Rather, these choices lead to other choices that can impact our entire lives. Instead of reviewing each option in light of what it offers now, imagine taking each option from start to finish. Write competing biographies based on each choice that you have, and choose the life you want. Write about the trials you will face. If you are choosing between industries (e.g., journalism v. law), research each industry’s typical career path, growth trajectory, and professional requirements. Write a biography for yourself in each industry based on what is realistically required for what you want to achieve. Once you write down all the work that will go into each career, do you still want both of them? Which of these paths resonates with you? Which of these journeys do you want to take? Write about the upside and the downside. If you are thinking of starting your own business or taking a job, your biographies should include your business and your target career at its highest and lowest points. How do you feel when you “make it”? What do you lose when things don’t work out? Which of these risks do you want to take? Write about the legacy you wish to leave. If you are conflicted about work/ life balance, write about what would happen if you took time off now or later or not at all. What is your ideal day in each scenario? What obstacles come in your way and how do you solve them? Do you have regrets? Which dreams do you want to pursue? It is tempting to make a decision for its short-term value without considering the path it clears for us in the long term. If we make each decision for the short term, we risk combining a haphazard series of events, rather than crafting a life of meaning and purpose. If we write our biographies now, we write a roadmap for our future and make a conscious decision on where we go. ________________________________Caroline Ceniza-Levine is co-founder of  a career coaching firm for Gen Y professionals.

Grubhub to surge 29% on superior scale: Wedbush#Investors should buy Grubhub due its market dominance, first-mover advantage and future growth potential, according to  Wedbush Securities, which initiated coverage of the internet food ordering company with  an outperform rating.  GRUB is the market leader in the growing online restaurant  ordering and delivery space and will continue to benefit from its early lead and superior size and scale, Wedbushs  Aaron Turner wrote in a note to clients Thursday.  We believe recent delivery initiatives and strategic  acquisitions coupled with continued diner adoption of  mobile-based restaurant take-out and delivery methods should  drive robust revenue and earnings growth for the foreseeable  future.
Heres how much the bull market helped savers#The Standard & Poors 500 Index has returned more than 200 percent since March  2009, the start of whats now the second-longest bull run in history.  Yet retirement savers and mom-and-pop investors havent seen such big gains. While 401(k) plan balances have  bounced back since their lows seven years ago, most Americans  still fall woefully short of the savings theyll need to last  them through retirement.  Back in 2007, people in their 60s had average 401(k) balances of  about $120,000. That figure plunged to about $90,000 in early  2009, and climbed back to more than $150,000 by the end of 2015,  according to data from Fidelity. For most, thats still  significantly short of the recommended account balance for people  on the brink of retirement: Eight to ten times your final salary.  Frankly, if you have only about $100,000, you arent going to be  able to retire, said Brooklyn, N.Y.-based financial planner Mark Sallinger.  While some expenses will wane, and you might no longer have kids  or a mortgage to pay for, health and medical costs are going  through the roof.  Indeed, although Americans of all ages have seen their retirement  accounts recover since the financial crisis, average balances  suggest even younger people are behind on reaching the  recommended targets of one times salary by age 30 and three times  salary by age 40.
Joe Biden unveils racial economic equity plan that calls for#WASHINGTON — Former Vice President Joe Biden unveiled a roadmap of policy proposals Tuesday that are aimed at narrowing the generational wealth gap that persists between White Americans and their Black, Latino, Asian and Native American neighbors.Bidens racial economic equity plan is the fourth plank in the presumptive Democratic presidential nominees Build Back Better economic platform. Biden announced the plan at a speech in Wilmington, Delaware. There, Biden drew a sharp contrast between his view of the national reckoning underway on racial justice and the ongoing protests in major cities, and the views of his opponent, President Donald Trump.Every instinct Trump has is to add fuel to the fire, said Biden. Its the last thing we need. We need leadership that will calm the waters and lower the temperature. Thats how to restore peace in the streets. Bidens economic equity plan is largely a repackaging of dozens of his existing proposals from across the campaigns platforms, such as his plan to offer a one-time student debt reduction of $10,000 per student and his call for a $15 hourly minimum wage.It also contains a separate section focused on criminal justice reform, which includes Bidens plan to eliminate cash bail and to guarantee that formerly incarcerated people are provided temporary housing upon release from prison. It will take all of these policies working together, he said, to begin to achieve economic equality for people of color.How do we break the cycle? In good times, communities of color still lag. In bad times, they get hit first and the hardest. And in recovery, they take the longest to bounce back. This is about justice ... its also about jobs, good-paying jobs. And financial stability, building wealth for families of color and passing it down to their kids.Here are some of the key proposals in Bidens economic equity plank: The New Markets Tax Credit program awards tax credits to investors who provide capital for community development entities, which finance projects in qualified low-income communities. Created by Congress in 2000, the NMTC has supported more than 5,300 projects in the past two decades, but it is scheduled to expire at the end of this year.Unlike the previous three planks in Bidens economic platform, the racial equity plan does not initially include demands for more federal spending. Instead, it is centered on the ways that funding Biden has already proposed in his first three planks is allocated. Speaking to reporters Tuesday morning, senior Biden campaign advisors said more details about the costs and the funding of these proposals are forthcoming, although they did not specify when to expect the numbers. One thing the plan does not contain is any reference to the word reparations, despite a growing movement on the left in recent years to quantify and compensate Black Americans for centuries of slave labor and for the subsequent Jim Crow laws that denied them access to the same opportunities to build wealth that White families were given.Grouping all of these policy proposals together under the umbrella of racial economic equity is one way for Bidens campaign to codify the former vice presidents commitment to addressing the deep-seated racial injustice that has sparked massive civil unrest across the country this summer. Biden said his plan is about rising to this moment of crisis. Understanding peoples struggles, and building a future worthy of their courage and their ambition to overcome.Read the entire plan below.
Russia sets stage for UN veto of western bid to#Russia has laid the groundwork for a likely veto on Monday of a British, U.S. and French bid for the United Nations Security Council to call out Iran over its weapons falling into the hands of Yemens Houthi group.The 15-member Security Council has to renew its targeted sanctions on Yemen on Monday. Russia has proposed a rival resolution that would simply extend the mandate of the regime for one year and not mention Iran.The United States has been lobbying for months for Iran to be held accountable at the United Nations, while at the same time threatening to quit a 2015 deal among world powers to curb Irans nuclear program if disastrous flaws are not fixed.Britain drafted a resolution in consultation with the United States and France that initially wanted to condemn Iran for violating an arms embargo on Houthi leaders and include a council commitment to take action over it.The latest British draft drops the condemnation and instead expresses concern that U.N. experts monitoring the sanctions reported Iran had violated a targeted arms embargo by failing to stop missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles reaching the Houthis.A proxy war is playing out in Yemen between Iran and U.S. ally Saudi Arabia. A Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing government forces fighting Iran-allied Houthi rebels. Iran has denied supplying the Houthis weapons.A U.N. Security Council resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by Russia, China, the United States, France or Britain to pass.Both resolutions seek to renew a U.N. ban on the supply of weapons to Houthi leaders and those acting on their behalf or at their direction. It can also blacklist individuals and entities for threatening the peace and stability of Yemen or hindering aid access.U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley took her Security Council colleagues to Washington in January to view pieces of missiles fired by the Houthis at Saudi Arabia in a bid to boost the U.S. case against Iran.Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said after the visit that he does not believe there is a case for United Nations action against Iran. Iran has described the arms displayed in Washington as fabricated.
French Work the Least in the World: Survey#The French spend the least amount of time at work, a new survey of 73 cities around the world by Swiss bank UBS shows, while the most hours are worked in Cairo and Seoul.On average, people in the cities surveyed worked 1,902 hours per year, but in Lyon and Paris they worked 1,582 and 1,594 hours respectively. In Cairo, they worked 2,373 hours, while in Seoul they worked 2,312 hours.The richest workers are in New York and Zurich, where they would have to work nine hours to buy an iPod nano, while workers in Mumbai needed to work 20 nine-hour days – nearly one months salary – to buy the gadget.Copenhagen, Zurich, Geneva and New York were the cities where employees had the highest gross wages. In terms of the most expensive cities, London fell from the top of the list to the 21st place because of the pounds devaluation, the survey showed.Oslo is the worlds most expensive city now, followed by Zurich, Copenhagen, Geneva and Tokyo, while New York was on the list at number 6. —An earlier version of this story misstated New Yorks rank as an expenisve city.
Should CEO pay be tied to share price?#In a filing with the SEC on Friday, Chipotle announced that a portion of future CEO compensation will be tied to the companys  share price performance.The move comes as health concerns have continued to plague the stock over the past year--it is now down 23%. According to the filing, shares will have to stay  above $700 for 30 consecutive days in order to trigger new stock  awards for executives.  The Halftime Report experts  and guest host, Rich Pzena, debated the potential merits--and pitfalls--of  tying CEO compensation to share price.
Billions flood into ETFs—and that could be an ‘A plus’#More than $40 billion has flowed into equity exchange-traded  funds since the election, according to recent Thomson Reuters  Lipper data. And that could signal upside for the market,  according to strategists who dont yet see a market top in  sight.     The overall health [of the market] is an A plus, Chad  Morganlander, portfolio manager at Stifel Nicolaus, said Friday  on CNBCs Trading Nation.  Morganlander, bullish on equities at these levels, cited analysts  lifting growth and earnings forecasts for next year and beyond.  He and his firm have upgraded long-term returns to anywhere from  6 to 7 percent, up from about 5 percent, and have upgraded their  2017 GDP outlook to 3 percent from 2.75 percent as well.  Since the election, the major indexes have surged; the , Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq Composite have  gained over 5 percent, nearly 8 percent, and 4 percent in that  time, respectively. Analysts see several forces at work pushing  the markets to record highs in recent weeks.   This rally is tied to Trumps business-friendly campaign  promises of lower corporate taxes, less regulation and a bump in  infrastructure spending, Pat Keon of Thomson Reuters Lipper  wrote in a recent report on U.S. fund flow data.  Whats more is that, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper data,  last week marked the fourth straight week of net inflows for  equity ETFs.   Indeed, the prospect of infrastructure spending has Phillip  Streible, senior market strategist at RJO Futures, bullish on  equities at these levels.   When you see infrastructure spending being promoted … you  also see tax cuts on businesses. … Youre going to see that  expansion across the board here, and that flow of funds is going  to happen, Streible said Friday on Trading  Nation.   Alas, these gains have come at the expense of the global bond  market, which in November saw record outflows.  So it was a reallocation of funds, and I wouldnt be surprised  if we see a continuation back to the upside, Streible  said.
Star Wars meets Uniqlo as Fast Retailing, Disney expand product#Fast Retailings Uniqlo clothing chain said on Monday that it was expanding its collaboration with Walt  Disney to offer a wider range of products and that it  would open a flagship store at the Florida Disney Worlds shopping complex  next spring.  The Japanese apparel retailer, which now offers T-shirts  featuring Mickey and Minnie Mouse, will extend its Disney-themed lineup to  offer at stores worldwide items ranging from its Ultra Light Down  collection and flannel shirts to umbrellas and toys.It will also use characters from the blockbuster movies Star  Wars, Toy Story, Avengers and Frozen.The move could add to awareness of Uniqlos brand as its global expansion gathers pace, with Fast Retailing expecting to have  more Uniqlo outlets overseas than in Japan by this autumn.
Fitch Rates $202MM New York Local Government Assistance Corp. Bonds#"NEW YORK, Nov 12, 2010 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Fitch Ratings assigns an AA rating
to the following New York Local Government Assistance Corporation (LGAC) bonds:

--$202,550,000 series 2010B refunding bonds (subordinate lien).The bonds are being issued for refunding purposes.In addition, Fitch affirms the AA rating on approximately $3.4 billion of
outstanding LGAC senior and subordinate lien bonds, including the underlying
rating on the series 2003A-4V bonds for which liquidity is being substituted and
insurance removed.Fitch does not make a rating distinction between the senior and subordinate
liens due to the strong coverage and impoundment provisions.The Rating Outlook is Stable.RATING RATIONALE:

--The designated source of payment, a portion of the state sales tax, is
broad-based and provides generous coverage of debt service.--Although bond payments require annual legislative appropriation, there are
strong protective provisions for insufficient funding and non-appropriation.Fitch believes that these features effectively eliminate the risk of
non-appropriation.--The states economy is broad, with substantial wealth and resources, although
the health of the states economy and finances is closely linked to the cyclical
financial services industry.--Strong financial planning and reporting practices, including quarterly
financial plan updates, allow the state to stay abreast of changing conditions.This credit strength is offset by the states historical tendency to rely on
nonrecurring measures rather than sustainable budget solutions to address
revenue weakening in downturns.--New Yorks debt burden is above average but still in the moderate range, and
pensions are well funded.KEY RATING DRIVERS:

--Changes in New York States general obligation (GO) rating, to which this
rating is linked.--The states GO rating will be driven by its continued ability to address
budget shortfalls and protect its cash position.---Further driving the states rating would be any meaningful change to the
shape of the financial services industry, which would have significant
implications for the states economy and finances.SECURITY:

LGACs bonds are general obligations of the corporation, payable, subject to
annual state legislative appropriation, from the yield of one cent of the
four-cent state sales and use tax required by statute to be deposited in the
local government assistance tax fund.CREDIT SUMMARY:

The strength of the states incentive to appropriate for the LGAC bonds results
in a rating equal to that assigned to New Yorks GO debt despite the
appropriation requirement for payment of debt service. In the event of
non-appropriation, the state would be unable to receive revenues held by the
LGAC tax fund, which receives one cent of the states sales tax and contributes
more than $2 billion to the state general fund. Security strengths include the
broad sales tax base, the consistently high level of coverage (about 6.3 times
(x) maximum annual debt service based on fiscal 2010 revenues), and the
structural protections in place. Fitch does not make a rating distinction
between the senior and subordinate liens due to the strong impoundment
provisions and coverage.LGAC was created in 1990 as a means of financing $4.7 billion of the states
accrued general fund deficit, replacing the annual spring borrowing for local
aid payments. The entire $4.7 billion authorization has been issued and
additional debt can only be issued for refunding purposes.New Yorks AA GO rating is based on the states substantial wealth and
resources and broad economy, and also recognizes concerns regarding the outsized
role that the financial services industry plays in the states economy and
revenue system. State net tax-supported debt levels have been relatively stable
as a percentage of personal income and are expected to remain above average but
still in the moderate range. Pensions are well funded.The states financial position has been strained. Revenue estimates for fiscal
2010, which ended on March 31, were revised downward repeatedly over the course
of the year, primarily reflecting reduced expectations for the personal income
tax. Despite gap-closing measures taken, fiscal 2010 ended with a deficit of
$1.65 billion that was carried over to fiscal 2011. The budget for fiscal 2011
was not finalized until early August, more than four months into the fiscal
year, although the debt service appropriation bill was passed before the start
of the fiscal year. A fiscal 2011 gap of about $9.2 billion including the
carried-over fiscal 2010 deficit ($8.5 billion after factoring in budget
measures taken in December 2009) was addressed through spending control,
particularly in the area of local aid, temporary and permanent revenue actions,
including a suspension of the sales tax exemption for clothing and a cigarette
tax increase to $4.35 per pack, and limited one-time measures. Deficit financing
was not part of the gap-closing plan; however, the budget includes a substantial
amount of federal stimulus funds. New York, which spends a larger than average
amount on Medicaid, garners particular benefit from the increase in the federal
Medicaid matching percentage included in the federal stimulus package.In contrast to prior downturns, recovery is expected to be slow, and the state
is projected to confront significant outyear budget gaps as federal stimulus and
temporary tax increase monies roll off. Earlier this month, the state reduced
its revenue forecast and increased expenditure expectations. The current fiscal
year (which ends on March 31, 2011) is now reported to have a $315 million
shortfall to be addressed. The fiscal 2012 shortfall estimate has increased to
$9 billion from $8.2 billion, with the large gap reflecting the phase-out of
federal stimulus monies. The gap forecast for fiscal 2013 is now $14.6 billion,
with the expiration of both stimulus funds and the temporary personal income tax
rate increase. Fitch believes that downside risk to the forecast remains.With steep revenue declines, the states cash position has been strained. The
state has taken proactive measures to ensure cash adequacy, and continued focus
on cash management measures will be necessary. The LGAC bonds are protected from
the cash flow issues by the flow of funds.New Yorks employment decline in the recession was less severe than that of the
nation. Nonfarm employment did not start to fall, year-over-year, until November
2008 and was down 2.7% in 2009 compared to a 4.3% drop for the U.S. In September
2010, jobs in New York were flat to the prior year while national figures were
up 0.2% year-over-year. Unemployment remains below that of the nation in
September 2010, at 8.3%, 86% of the U.S. level. Personal income performance has
been meaningfully weaker than that of the nation, down 3.1% in 2009, almost
double the national loss and the fourth worst of the states. The states
personal income per capita was the sixth highest among the states in 2009, at
117% of the U.S. average.New Yorks net tax-supported debt is above average but still in the moderate
range at 5.6% of personal income. Most of New Yorks debt has been issued by
state public authorities and secured by appropriations; only about 7% is GO.While this results in a diffuse debt structure, there is strong centralization
and oversight in the budget division, and approval by the public authorities
control board is required for many of these bond issues.Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com.In addition to the sources of information identified in the report

No Consensus On Democrat Big Oil Bill#At this hour, as crude oil futures are trading below $50 per barrel for the first time since May 2005, the U.S. House of Representatives is voting on a controversial bill that targets the oil industry with higher taxes, fees and royalties. The bill is expected to pass the House with ease. “Power Lunch” covered all the bases of the proposed legislation, hosting a debate between Sterling Burnett of the National Center for Policy Analysis and Karen Wayland of the Natural Resources Defense Council.Before we get into the debate – a few notes on the proposed bill: first: it would effectively prohibit oil companies from receiving an income tax deduction – one that was enacted in 2004 for the domestic manufacturing sector. It also requires Big Oil to renegotiate leases issued in error in 1998 and 1999 for drilling rights in the Gulf of Mexico. If they refuse to renegotiate, they must instead pay a fee. The bill imposes another fee on all non-producing oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico.Also in the bill is $14-15 billion earmarked for the exploration and development of alternative energy. Burnett believes we should actually “put the brakes” on alternative energies like ethanol, corn and soy diesel because of the collateral damage it creates for the poor. He points to the doubling of the price of corn in the last year as an example of how this can hurt consumers – especially the lower class.
UK MPs call for AI commission to tackle the ‘Star#The U.K. is not ready for how artificial intelligence (AI) will  fundamentally reshape the way we live and work, lawmakers  warned in a report on Wednesday.  U.K. members of parliament (MPs) have called for the creation of  an artificial intelligence (AI) commission to examine the effect  new technologies will have on society.   Artificial intelligence has some way to go before we see systems  and robots as portrayed in the creative arts such as Star Wars,  Tania Mathias, interim chair of the U.K. parliaments science and  technology select committee, said in a statement.   But science fiction is slowly becoming science fact, and  robotics and AI look destined to play an increasing role in our  lives over the coming decades.

A mobile addict is defined as a user that launches apps more  than 60 times a day, according to mobile analytics firm Flurry,  six times more than the average user.

Damian Lewis a front-runner for James Bond role: Report#Former Homeland star Damian Lewis is now among the front-runners  to become the next James Bond, The Hollywood Reporter said  Tuesday.  The report said that British bookmaker William Hill raised Lewis  odds of taking the mantle of the fictional MI-6 spy from 25/1 to  3/1, just behind Idris Elbas odds of 5/2.  This is an unprecedented gamble, as for no apparent reason we  have seen bets of up to £200 [$312] on Damian Lewis being  named as the next Bond. This could well be significant and might  herald the end of Daniel Craig as the worlds most famous spy, a  William Hill spokesperson told the publication.Read More  Why and how Jurassic World broke records  Craig has been playing Bond since 2006.

Off to a Rocky Start#S&P 500 futures drop about 6 points as August durable good orders were well below expectations: down 2.4 percent vs. consensus of up 0.4 percent. The dollar rallied, as it did yesterday on the disappointing existing home sales report. Elsewhere: 1) KB Home down 5 percent despite posting a narrower-than-expected Q3 loss as better margins and smaller writedowns. The homebuilders revenues fell 33 percent as home deliveries fell 20 percent and average prices declined 15 percent. However, new orders soared 62 percent from the year-ago quarter, but were down 27 percent sequentially from the prior quarter. Weighing on the shares is CEO Jeff Mezgers cautious comments: it will likely be some time before we see meaningful improvement in the economic conditions that are essential to our industrys future growth. 2) Sara Lee rises 7 percent pre-open after Unilever agreed to buy its soap and personal care units for $1.9 billion dollars. The acquisition allows Unilever to diversify its portfolio of consumer product brands, while the deal will help Sara Lee repurchase $1 billion in stock and invest for growth in core businesses. The companies expect the deal to close next year. 3) Another IPO: The busy week for IPOs continues today. Shanda Games (GAME) priced its Nasdaq-listed shares at $12.50 - at the high end of the previously announced range of $10.50-$12.50. The Chinese online video game operator raised $1 billion and becomes the biggest IPO in the U.S. this year. 4) Were growing, but not as much as you wanted. Hewlett Packard down 1 percent pre-open as CEO Mark Hurd said the magic words: We expect the IT industry to return to growth in 2010 and believe that HP will outpace the market, but their guidance was not as strong as expected. Diluted EPS in the range of $4.20 to $4.30 was near analyst estimates of $4.23, while revenue of approximately $117.0 billion to $118.0 billion is below consensus of $118 billion. 5) Airlines trading up about 2 percent pre-open as UBS upgrades airlines including AMR , Continental, US Air, with United its top pick. UBS says that Thanks to the recent flurry of capital raises the balance sheets of several of US airlines will be flush with new cash. 6) Goldman Sachs upgrades refining sectorm including Holly, Occidental  and Sunoco. 7) The two-day decline in stocks (less than 2 percent on the S&P 500), has some again wondering about the long-sought correction. Bears point out that we have moved over 50 percent since the March lows and are due for a correction, but Laszlo Birinyi (quoted in Morningstar) notes that there is little evidence for an imminent correction: Give me the evidence...in 1982 we went 424 days before we had a correction. In 2000, we went seven years before we had a 10% correction. In 2002, we went three or four years. 8) Short interest continues to decrease. Traders have bitterly complained that shorting the market has been a recipe for disaster in the past several months; many have told me they have been shorting much less. We continue to get evidence that shorting is indeed down. From August 31st to September 15th, the total amount of securities on the S&P 500 sold short dropped by 7.3 percent. __________________________________________________________Questions?  Comments?  tradertalk@cnbc.com
Ukraine rebels ignore Putin call to delay self-rule vote#Pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine ignored a public call by Russian President Vladimir Putin  to postpone a referendum on self-rule, declaring they would go ahead on Sunday  with a vote that could lead to war.The decision,which contradicted the  conciliatory tone set by Putin just a day earlier, caused consternation in the West, which fears the  referendum will tear Ukraine apart.U.S. Deputy Secretary of State William Burns  said Russia was heading down a dangerous and irresponsible path and the situation in Ukraine  was extremely combustible.Denis Pushilin, a leader of the self-declared  separatist Donetsk Peoples Republic, expressed gratitude to Putin but said the Peoples  Council had voted unanimously on Thursday to hold the plebiscite as planned.
Stocks End Slightly Higher; Earnings Little Help#Stocks closed slightly higher as a mostly positive start to earnings season was offset by the air quickly coming out of a rally in bank stocks.Financials surged Monday following a bullish call from noted analyst Meredith Whitney, but the sector was the markets biggest drag on Tuesday even though Goldman Sachs reported earnings that blew past Wall Streets expectations.Investors were wary after economic data showed larger-than-expected gains in producer prices and retail sales—but both readings came largely on the backs of auto and energy sales. With the two volatile areas stripped out, the numbers reflected anemic consumer growth that has been exacerbated by rising unemployment.The economic reports triggered expectations of inflation, and at least some of the late-morning pop in stocks was attributed to short-covering.
Huawei CEO says its working on 6G — but the#Huawei has begun research on 6G — the successor to 5G mobile networks which are not yet widespread, according to its CEO Ren Zhengfei.5G is the name of next-generation mobile networks that promises super-fast data speeds and the ability to underpin new technologies like driverless cars. These networks are slowly rolling out in places such as South Korea, the U.K. and soon China. However, they are not yet available on a large scale.However, Huaweis founder Ren is already talking about 6G.
US Stocks Seen Higher, Boosted by Bernanke Speech#U.S. stock index futures signaled a marginally higher open on  Thursday, with European and Asian shares boosted after Federal  Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke reiterated his support for  ultra-easy monetary policy on Wednesday.    In his second day of testimony on Capitol Hill on Wednesday,  Bernanke said loose monetary policy was boosting  employment.    We believe the monetary policies we have conducted have helped  get stronger recovery and more jobs than we otherwise would have  had, he said, according to Reuters.    Bernanke forecast it would take three more years for unemployment  to decline to 6 percent, further diminishing concerns the Fed  might tighten policy sooner than expected. Previously, Bernanke  has said he will keep interest rates low until unemployment falls  to around 6.5 percent.    U.S. gains may be capped however by uncertainty about whether a  last-minute deal can be struck to avert the $85 billion of  spending cuts, known as the sequester, due to hit on  Friday.    In his testimony, Bernanke warned Congress of the dangers of  failing to reach an agreement on how to combat  sequestration.    I think there is some cost to the economy of these repeated, I  wont say crises, but these repeated episodes where Congress is  unable to come to some agreement and therefore some automatic  thing kicks in. I think that is on the whole not a good thing for  confidence, Bernanke said on Wednesday, according to  Reuters.   Meanwhile, a heavy day for economic releases will get underway  with the governments release of its latest estimate of fourth  quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at 8:30 a.m. New York time.  Economists polled by Reuters forecast a sharp rise on the  previous estimate, to 0.5 percent annualized growth, after the  previous forecast suggested GDP declined by 0.1 percent in the  fourth quarter.    This upward revision is likely to be a result of both exports  and consumption being higher than previously thought, wrote Paul  Dales, a U.S. economist at independent research firm Capital  Economics, in a note on Wednesday afternoon.    Whats more, despite the expiry of the payroll tax cut in  January, the early evidence suggests that GDP growth accelerated  in the first quarter of this year.   Hopes for upbeat first quarter growth figures were boosted by  Wednesdays release of durable goods data for January from the  Commerce Department. Core orders, excluding transportation,  posted their biggest gain since December 2011, rising 1.9 percent  month-on-month.    In a note on Wednesday, Peter Newland, a U.S. economist at  Barclays, said that taking into account the durable goods data  numbers, he forecast 1.3 percent growth in the first  quarter.    Other economic data out on Thursday includes the Labor  Departments weekly initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m.  Economists polled by Reuters forecast there were 360,000 new  claims in the week ending February 23, down from 362,000 in the  previous week.   The Chicago Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) of manufacturing  activity is due at 9:45 a.m. Analysts polled by Reuters predict a  reading of 54.3 for February, down from 55.6 percent last month.  PMI index readings above 50 signal an increase or improvement on  the prior month, while readings below 50 indicate a decrease.   Also, the Energy Department will issue its weekly look at natural  gas inventories across the U.S. at 10:30 a.m. on Thursday.  Inventories fell by 127 billion cubic feet in the prior week.   On the corporate front, Thursday will be a busy day for retail  earnings, with Best Buy, Kohls, and Barnes & Noble posting  results before the start of U.S. trade.    Barnes & Nobles results will be eyed with interest after  stakeholder Liberty Media said on Wednesday that it had the power  to block a sale of the bookseller, and is waiting to hear if  Barnes & Noble Chairman Leonard Riggio will make an  offer.    Sears Holdings reported forecast-beating earnings for the fourth  quarter early on Thursday.   Groupon shares will also be watched, after the discount voucher  provider lost a quarter of its market value on Wednesday when it  revealed it had started taking a smaller commission on deals  during the holidays, in order to retain merchants.    - By CNBCs Katy Barnato
Israels Offshore Gas — Bonanza or Security Threat?#The Middle East, source of much of the world’s hydrocarbons, is one of the most volatile regions on earth, where energy issues impact international relations. From Iraqi oil output, still struggling to reach its 2003 pre-invasion levels through Iran’s sanctioned nuclear program, the region focuses the world’s attention like nowhere else.
Netflix earnings: Street looks for signs of global traction#The media industrys current mantra is content is king but for  analysts watching Netflix this week, subscribers are  king — more specifically international subscribers.   When Netflix reports third-quarter results Wednesday evening,  its expected to post a 43 percent decline in earnings per share,  while sales are forecast to rise 24 percent, but the real story  about the state of its global expansion.   The streaming giant has laid down roots in hosts of new markets, most  recently Japan in the third quarter, and it plans to expand  further into Europe during the fourth quarter. Wall Street will  undoubtedly be looking for signs that the expansion is gaining  traction.

US urges judge to deny Huawei motion in government effort#U.S. prosecutors on Monday asked a judge to reject a motion by Chinas Huawei seeking information on the grounds for a government request to disqualify the companys lead defense lawyer in a criminal case alleging bank fraud and sanctions violations.    Last month, prosecutors argued Huawei lawyer James Coles prior position as the No. 2 official in the U.S. Department of Justice created conflicts of interest that necessitated his removal.    The prosecutors said Cole, who served as deputy attorney general (DAG) until 2015, represented the government in a related investigation, without disclosing details. Huawei asked the court to review overbroad redactions in the U.S. motion seeking his removal.    Huawei wants prosecutors to reveal the very information it is trying to prevent the new client from learning, the prosecutors said in a letter to Judge Ann Donnelly in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, New York.   The conflict presented here is unprecedented, the prosecutors argued. The government was not aware of any other senior DOJ official who had sought to represent a client that had been part of his government work, let alone when the former representation involved classified information, they said.    A spokesman for Huawei Technologies, the worlds largest telecommunications equipment maker, declined to comment, and Cole did not respond to a request for comment. Cole entered a not guilty plea on behalf of Huawei in March.

CDC reverses indoor mask policy, saying fully vaccinated people and#The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended Tuesday that fully vaccinated people begin wearing masks indoors again in places with high Covid-19 transmission rates. The agency is also recommending kids wear masks in schools this fall.Federal health officials still believe fully vaccinated individuals represent a very small amount of transmission. Still, some vaccinated people could be carrying higher levels of the virus than previously understood and potentially transmit it to others.This pandemic continues to pose a serious threat to the health of all Americans, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky told reporters on a call. Today, we have new science related to the delta variant that requires us to update the guidance regarding what you can do when you are fully vaccinated.The updated guidance comes ahead of the fall season, when the highly contagious delta variant is expected to cause another surge in new coronavirus cases and many large employers plan to bring workers back to the office. In mid-May, the CDC said fully vaccinated people didnt need to wear masks in most settings, whether indoors or outdoors.In areas with substantial and high transmission, CDC recommends fully vaccinated people wear masks in public, indoor settings to help prevent the spread of the delta variant, and protect others. This includes schools, Walensky said. The CDC recommends that everyone in grade schools wear masks indoors, including teachers, staff, students and visitors, regardless of vaccination status.Walensky said new data shows the variant behaves uniquely differently from past strains of the virus, indicating that some vaccinated people infected with the delta variant may be contagious and spread the virus to others.Read More: Americans will need masks indoors as U.S. heads for dangerous fall with surge in delta Covid casesHealth experts fear delta, already the dominant form of the disease in the U.S., is hitting states with low vaccination rates.

Insurers choose their partners. So how big will the dance#Aetna  and Humana have announced a $35 billion  cash and stock agreement to merge, one day after Centene indicated it  planned to buy its Medicaid-focused rival Healthnet for $6.8  billion.   Should Anthem and Cigna eventually reach a deal to combine their  businesses, it will mark one of the most significant eras of  consolidation in the history of the health insurance  sector. Yet the question remains whether regulators will embrace  the deals as quickly as these rivals have embraced one another.  Four of the largest U.S. insurers will combine to form two health-care powerhouses, and the competition may spur more mergers among  smaller players. The effect is going to be very specific to markets, said  Christopher Koller, the president of the Milbank Memorial Fund, a  health policy research foundation that advises states. Read MoreWhat the [Federal Trade Commission] will want to determine  is, does an insurer have a big enough market share in a  particular market so as to eliminate or reduce competition,  asked Koller, who served as Rhode Islands health insurance  commissioner from 2006-2013.  Still, Koller argues that when it comes to insurance the bar has  been set fairly high by federal regulators.  I regulated a  market where a domestic, local, non-profit (Blue Cross plan) had  60-70 percent of market share. And I certainly didnt have the  FTC marching in there trying to take it apart, he said.  Yet current Rhode Island Health Insurance Commissioner Kathleen  Hittner said these new large insurer deals should be carefully  scrutinized because it could hurt the burgeoning consumer  market.  People want consolidation for efficiency, which is what  (insurers) promote, said Hittner. If you have competition, they  look at the other plans and they try to have similar plans, she  said.  I think if you take away that competition, we will see higher  rates and we will see less ability for the states to adjust those  rates, she added.
U.S. lawmakers agree Big Tech has too much power, but#Yesterdays Big Tech Congressional hearing featured something thats exceedingly rare in Washington: bipartisan agreement. Sure, there was the expected grandstanding about hypothetical conservative bias, and weird questions about emails going into spam folders and when HBO Max would be on Amazon Fire TV. But there was also a strikingly consistent belief among the 15 members of the U.S. House of Representatives Antitrust Subcommittee that Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google have too much power.Both Republican and Democratic Congressmen laid out instances where companies have stifled competition, including Amazon using data from third-party sellers against them and Facebooks internal discussions about how buying startups Instagram and WhatsApp could choke off eventual threats. While the CEOs respectfully disagreed with many characterizations, years of deflection around touchy issues may have undermined their overall credibility with both lawmakers and the public. So Congress thinks theres a real problem here. But we didnt learn anything about what they plan to do about it. And thats probably because the members simply dont know. Its likely all four companies will be highly scrutinized for any market pivots or strategic acquisitions moving forward. But scrutiny doesnt equal action. This isnt a new American problem. Its easy to diagnose problems: Rising health care costs, growing inequality, electoral college unfairness, and so on. Doing something about them takes bold leadership and, sometimes, fumbling legislation. It would have been nice to hear some ideas about how the companies would respond to potential legislative or regulatory solutions, such as spin-outs of divisions (Google and YouTube, Facebook and Instagram), restrictions on future strategic acquisitions, or laws around Apples App Store policies. Theres not going to be a one-size-fits-all legislative or regulatory fix for the four companies. Each company has its own dominance issues, making it unfeasible to create a single broad law that applies to all of them. But it was notable that representatives both sides of the aisle basically came to the same conclusion.This type of basic agreement -- even at the lowest levels of there seems to be a problem here -- is increasingly rare in high-profile Congressional hearings, which often degrade into political showcases where Democrats take one side and Republicans argue the opposite. While Sensenbrenner did note that bigger companies arent necessarily problematic, there were few, if any, comments echoing what Morgan Stanley Vice Chairman Robert Kindler told CNBC earlier this week:I think companies like Amazon have been absolutely terrific for the economy and for the consumer, Kindler said. What would we have done during this pandemic if we didnt have companies like Amazon? I just cant imagine that people dont think that these are fantastic things that all of these huge companies have brought.
Italys Letta says anyone wanting him to resign must say#Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta made clear on Wednesday  he had no intention of resigning and said that if the center-left  leader Matteo Renzi wants to replace him he must state it  openly.

EMerge Alliance Releases Version 1.1 of Occupied Space Standard#Progress continues toward integrated standards for DC microgrids in      buildings        SAN RAMON, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--      The      EMerge Alliance – an open industry association leading the rapid      adoption of safe direct-current (DC) power distribution standards for      commercial buildings – today announced it has updated the EMerge      Alliance Occupied Space standard, the first application platform model      for the utilization of low-voltage DC power in commercial interiors.          The EMerge Alliance Occupied Space standard creates an integrated, open      platform for power, interior infrastructures, controls and a wide      variety of peripheral devices to facilitate the hybrid use of AC and DC      power within commercial buildings. Version 1.1 includes several      important updates to voltage limits, recommended cable sizes and other      requirements to assist companies developing products when using the      standard. These changes are backwards compatible and maximize the      interoperability and efficiency of EMerge Alliance Registered products.          According to Alliance Chairman Brian Patterson, the Occupied Space      standard version 1.1 allows for better connectivity with the forthcoming      EMerge Alliance Task Level/Furnishings standard and contributes to the      organization’s push to deliver a portfolio of integrated standards that      increase building flexibility and sustainability, while lowering      operating costs. These standards also facilitate the direct use of      on-site power generation and storage, which eliminates the need for many      inefficient power form conversions in buildings.          “The standards we’re creating for DC microgrids are the keys to      unlocking unprecedented efficiency, flexibility and sustainability in      buildings,” said Patterson. “The latest advancements in the EMerge      Alliance Occupied Space standard demonstrate that the Alliance is      committed to driving the continued development and expansion of      standards that will deliver DC power throughout buildings.”          The EMerge Alliance Occupied Space standard has been well received by      both product manufacturers and the early adopters of the building      community. There are more than 50 EMerge Alliance Registered products      available for use today, representing everything needed to implement the      platform. The EMerge Alliance Occupied Space standard version 1.1 is      available exclusively to Governing, Participating and General Members of      the Alliance, and a free public overview is available at http://www.emergealliance.org/Standard/RequestStandard.aspx.      To join the Alliance, please visit http://emergealliance.org/Join/HowtoJoin.aspx.     The EMerge Alliance’s Growing Standards Portfolio       The EMerge Alliance continues to work toward completing new DC power      standards to achieve net-zero energy buildings. The soon-to-be-released      Data/Telecom Center standard will provide a practical guide for the      hybrid use of DC power in data centers, offering better efficiency, a      smaller footprint, improved reliability and lower capital and      installation costs. Currently in development, the Campus Microgrid      standard will focus on establishing a standard for the integration of DC      microgrids throughout whole buildings. Also in progress, the Task      Level/Furnishings standard connects DC power to desktop technologies and      applications. Moving forward, the Alliance will continue its vision by      developing future standards for building services, such as HVAC, and      outdoor applications, such as electric vehicle charging. All EMerge      Alliance standards include consideration of power, infrastructure,      peripheral device and control applications required to operate a      building application platform using DC power.     About the EMerge Alliance       The EMerge Alliance is an open industry association leading the rapid      adoption of safe DC power distribution in commercial buildings through      the development of EMerge Alliance standards. These innovative standards      integrate interior infrastructures, power, controls and devices in      common microgrid platforms to facilitate the hybrid use of AC and DC      power throughout buildings for unprecedented design and space      flexibility, greater energy efficiency and improved sustainability. The      nonprofit Alliance is accepting new members at various levels. For more      information, please visit www.EMergeAlliance.org.
Nadja Swarovski: The luxury sector has been ‘incredibly resilient’ amid#LONDON — Nadja Swarovski, chair of the Swarovski Foundation, said that the luxury sector had effectively embraced the challenge of operating and reaching consumers amid the coronavirus pandemic. Swarovski, the first female executive board member for her familys luxury jewelry brand, was speaking at CNBCs Evolve Global Summit on Wednesday. She told CNBCs Tania Bryer that the luxury sector, to a certain extent has been incredibly resilient and I think those companies who have been digitally savvy have absolutely embraced this opportunity to communicate with their customers on a digital scale. In addition, Swarovski said it had been fantastic to see how the fashion industry has embraced this dilemma, with non-essential retail businesses in many countries having been temporarily closed due to lockdowns and other Covid-19 public health restrictions for most of the past year. Swarovski pointed to the use of digital fashion shows, in place of physical events, as well as fashion designers communicating directly more with the consumer. For instance, fashion label Alexander McQueen invited fans to take on various design challenges and share their creations on Instagram by tagging the brand, along with the hashtag McQueenCreators. Danish brand Ganni also launched a challenge inviting fans of the label to create and send in images or artwork around the theme of Home is where the heart is, to be selected for a place in an exhibition in Copenhagen and potentially win gift cards. Swarovski believed that more direct dialogue with consumers would help designers become more tailored to customer demands and hoped that would help reduce waste in the fashion industry. She pointed out that a quarter of all clothing produced last year went unworn, or even touched, before ending up in waste disposal sites. Data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, showed that on average each American produces about 75 pounds of textile waste a year. I think with this direct communication and also further transparency in the supply chain, that will be certainly mitigated, Swarovski said.
Global investors find a new love as consumer confidence soars#An increased appetite for emerging markets has grown in recent months, with global investors moving on following excitement over U.S and then European equities.

Kevin Durant took a nearly $10 million pay cut to#Golden State Warriors star player Kevin Durant proves that there really is no I — or $ — in team.For the fourth consecutive year, the Warriors are playing against the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA finals. But this time around, in order to keep their championship-winning team intact, Durant agreed to a nearly $10 million pay cut ahead of the season. After winning last years NBA title, Business Insider reports that the 29-year-old signed a two-year contract with the team that pays him $25 million for this 2017-2018 season. That figure is $1.5 million less than he made the previous year, and $9.5 million less than he was eligible to receive.In agreeing to the deal, which USA Today says is worth between $51-$53 million in total, Durant proves that short-term losses can sometimes set you up for long-term gain.

Opposites do attract, says Dr. Neil Clark Warren, an expert of  sorts in dating. Theres something fascinating about finding  someone who likes you who is very different from you.  But in an interview with CNBCs On  The Money, the founder and CEO of the eHarmony online dating  site warns that, over time, opposites attract, and then they  attack. Read MoreTinder not just for singles:  Report  After 35 years of counseling married couples, Warren says hes  learned that if the right person doesnt marry the right person,  youve got real problems ahead. Its tough to bend people after  they first get married.  Warren is a clinical psychologist and has written eight books on  love and marriage. Fifteen years ago, he launched eHarmony, the  site that helped pioneer the electronic dating era. The  privately held company claims that 600,000 married couples  have met on the site, which—if accurate—accounts for  nearly 4 percent of all U.S. marriages.      The dating service business is a $2.4 billion industry, according to market  research firm IBISWorld, while eHarmony has a nearly 14 percent  market share among online dating sites. The leader in the  category with a 21.8 percent share of the market is IAC/InterActiveCorp, which runs dating  sites such as match.com, OKCupid and Tinder.   The eHarmony site charges up to $60 a month and requires users to  fill out a lengthy questionnaire. Warren says: We ask every  question we can think to ask ... and we match them so carefully  on 29 dimensions. We call it broad-based compatibility and its  what you have to have.  When asked what the most important characteristic is in  successful relationships, Warren tells CNBC that Intelligence is  really important when it comes to matching people for  marriage.   The dating guru added that, We have to ask the questions that get  at intelligence so we can pair people up so they wont find  themselves feeling hurt because the other person is saying things  they dont understand.
Why this winning sector may be a bad idea#One of the best performing sectors in the market last week may  not be the best investing idea.  The S&P 500s financial sector showed a 2.3 percent gain last  week. But according to Ari Wald, head of technical analysis, only  certain types of financial companies are worth buying. That is  why hes not keen on the ETF that tracks the financial sector as  a whole (trading under the ticker symbol XLF).  I like financials selectively, but I dont think the XLF is the  best way to play it, Wald said.  Though the XLF broke above a key resistance level last week and  made new highs, Wald believes there are some signals the recent  rally is not all in the sector as a whole.   (Read: )  Only a net 17 stocks of the 84 that are in the sector made a new  52-week high with it, Waldsaid. So its a very selective move,  not broadlybased. A little bit of a closer look will show that  the capital markets industry and the REITs industry were the big  drivers of this trend. These are the industries that we want to  buy.  Wald, however, is worried about the banks. I think XLF has too  much exposure to the banks, he said. I would rather be a little  more selective and concentrate on the industries rather than the  sector.  Gina Sanchez, founder of Chantico Global, is on the same page as  Wald when it comes to the XLFs exposure to banks.  (Read: Citigroup facing restrictions  on sales of hedge fund investments: Report)  Banks make up about 36 percent of the XLFs holdings. Thats a  huge driver of how it will do, said Sanchez, a CNBC contributor.  To the extent that we dont have a constructive view on banks,  its hard to get really excited about the XLF.  Though banks have had good earnings results in the second quarter  of 2014, Sanchez thinks that already has been priced into the  stocks.  Performance has really been bid up over the last several  months, Sanchez said. At this point youre looking for even  more performance than theyve already given, and Im not sure  thats possible. So if you have a bad view on banks, you probably  dont have a great view on XLF. To see the full discussion on the XLF, with Wald on the  technicals and Sanchez on the fundamentals, watch the above  video.  -----  Follow us on Twitter: @CNBCNumbers  Like us on Facebook: facebook.com/CNBCNumbers

Amazons A.I. camera could help people with memory loss recognize#Sachin Solkhan, a veteran software engineer who works with Fidelity Investments, has thought a lot about how technology can help people with dementia recognize their loved ones. So when Amazon launched its DeepLens camera in November 2017, he got the idea to use its artificial intelligence software to do just that. Ahead of the devices official launch later this week, he attended a hackathon on his own time to build a system that records a users experiences and recognizes the person right in front of them. I wanted to find a way to use the device to help out someone who is struggling, he said.  DeepLens is Amazons equivalent of Googles Clips smart camera, but its targeted to developers instead of consumers. The idea is to use artificial intelligence technology to make it easier for the camera to do things like recognize objects or characters that appear in a video stream.
Cramer game plan—My great Fed-pectations in week ahead#Just when Jim Cramer thought the market was done worrying about the  drama of foreign lands, suddenly China brought the focus right back to where  it was with Greece a few weeks ago.  Yes, the idea that there is big trouble in not-so-little China, based on some very weak Chinese factory orders and a stock  market that is being proper up by the Communist party, lay behind  todays carnage, the Mad Money host.  The complete rollover of the commodity sector has investors  thinking that something evil lurking in China might take the whole world down with it. This was evident when the  breathtaking collapse of raw goods on Friday had things falling  apart all over the place.  All over the place... except for the United States. In fact, Cramer  suspects that the confluence of the robust economy in the U.S.  with problems overseas will really hit home next  week. (Tweet This)  On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will be making its decision on  interest rates. Due to the very robust job growth currently in  the U.S., the Fed is widely expected to confirm that it will  raise interest rates in September.
Week Ahead: Traders look for clarity from China, Fed#Stocks start the week on a nervous footing, with traders looking  for signals from both China and the Fed to turn the tide.  While stocks could see a reflex pop after last weeks nearly six  percent decline in the S&P 500, traders see the potential for  the first double digit decline in the S&P in four years and a  possible rocky period ahead. S&P/Capital IQ strategist Sam Stovall said the S&P 500, in fact, could see its first negative year since 2011, if it does fall into a true correction of 10 percent or more. Should the S&P slip into a long overdue correction  mode, it will likely take longer than year end to get back to  break even, said Stovall. In 2011, the S&P was just very  slightly lower, down much less than 1 percent. Before that it was  last lower in 2008. As of now, it is down 4.3 percent for the  year.  Markets have been spooked by a slowing China and traders are  watching for signs of further stimulus from China as well as  clarity from the Fed on whether a September rate hike is still  possible.
The market comeback: Focus on economic data and earnings, says#Despite the gloomy budget headlines from Washington and the tragic events in Manchester, England, new records were set this week by both the Nasdaq and the . Both have posted gains for seven consecutive sessions, matching seven-day win streaks for each that ran through Feb. 15. The Nasdaq last had an eight-day win streak in February 2015, while the S&Ps most recent eight-day win streak happened in July 2013.Kourtney Gibson, president of Loop Capital Markets, told CNBCs On The Money this week that I think the market is somewhat desensitized a little bit from some of these things. I think the good news is that we are actually focused on economic data and actually focused on the earnings that we are seeing coming out of the market right nowRecent earnings winners included Wal-Mart and Home Depot, signs of life in the dismal retail sector. Last week, HP, Medtronic and Best Buy all posted better-than-expected earnings. On the data front, a fresh reading on gross domestic product showed a better number than the first estimate. Manufacturing PMI for May also saw better-than-expected numbers with new orders at their best level of the year and employment improving.Looking ahead to next months two-day Federal Reserve meeting, where a rate rise is expected, Gibson says a hike could ultimately be good news for savers. For the average American raised interest rates obviously mean higher mortgage rates potentially on the long end of course, auto loan rates will go up. Hopefully we will begin to see some of those savings rates increase for the consumer, Gibson said. Id love to see some of the larger bulge-bracket investment banks and commercial banks begin to raise the savings rates for the average consumer as well.Gibson warns this weeks big market headlines shouldnt throw a monkey wrench into your investment strategy. Just stay the course.Hopefully you are investing for the long term and your financial advisor or whoever is helping you with determining your asset allocation is positioning you for the time horizon which you currently have, in which youll actually need the money, she said. So, changing something based just on this week is probably not advisable for most.Meanwhile, all three major indexes posted gains for the week, breaking two-week losing streaks for the Dow and S&P 500.On the Money airs on CNBC Saturdays at 5:30 am ET, or check listings for air times in local markets.
Slack says its going to replace email and is as#Business messaging service Slack briefed investors on Monday, as the company expects to go public with a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange on June 20.Slack provided updated information in an amendment to its initial public offering filing ahead of its pitch to investors. For the quarter ending April 30, Slack brought in revenue estimated between $133.8 to $134.8 million, up from $80.9 million in the same period a year ago. Slacks net loss expanded to about $39 million in the quarter, from $26.3 million.The service, which primarily caters to businesses, said it has more than 10 million users as of January. In its briefing to investors, Slack said it will release first quarter earnings and host a conference call on June 10, as well as give a second quarter forecast.Stewart Butterfield, co-founder and CEO of Slack, made the case that replacing email with Slack changes the way employees of a company communicate.This shift is inevitable. We believe every organization will switch to Slack or something like it, Butterfield said in a presentation.He also pitched Slack as a software-focused company that believes the world is only at the beginning of its reliance on software. In that essence, Butterfield likened Slack as eventually becoming a utility, similar to the internet or electricity.The world is going to continue to use more and more software and we deliberately try to put ourselves in a position where Slack the company gets more valuable as the world uses more software because Slack the product becomes more valuable for our customers as that customer uses more software, Butterfield said.Slack is the latest in a string of large technology companies coming to the public markets. But rather than a traditional IPO, the service will list its shares directly on the NYSE. Its the second major tech company over the last year to opt for a direct listing, following Spotify. Slacks ticker symbol will be SK.Slack, similar to the recent IPOs of Lyft and Pinterest, will offer two classes of shares, to consolidate voting power among its top shareholders. Slacks Class A common stock will receive one vote per share, while Class B will be entitled to 10 votes per share.Disclosure: Comcast Ventures, the venture arm of Comcast, is an investor in Slack. Comcast owns CNBC parent company NBCUniversal.
Did EA Bust the Social Gaming Bubble?#When Electronic Arts bought social games maker Playfish for $300  million—plus a $100 million buyout—in 2009, it sent shock  waves throughout the videogame industry. Spurred by growing  speculation about the value of then-private Zynga, some tech pros  say it was the beginning of a bubble for developers who  specialize in Facebook games.  On Monday, EA once again surprised the tech world – this  time by announcing plans to axe several games on the social  network, including The Sims Social, SimCity Social and Pet  Society. When those titles shut down on June 14, Playfish may not  have any active games—thus raising questions about its  fate. (EA declined to discuss the future of Playfish, saying it  was not commenting on individual teams.)  The Sims Social was once one of the most popular games on  Facebook, with daily active users topping 10 million. It has  fallen off of those highs, though, in a big way: Today, the game  boasts just 500,000 daily players, according to App Data –  and may soon fall out of the Top 100 Facebook titles; its  currently ranked 98th.

Healthcare Market Success: Cave Consulting Group (CCGroup) Affirms Continued Downloads#SAN MATEO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--      CCGroup announced in April 2012 the release of a free download      version of the Cave      Grouper™ software known as CaveGrouper-Lite™. This is the      first public grouper of medical condition episodes-of-care.      CaveGrouper-Lite™ builds longitudinal episodes of care for acute      conditions (e.g., upper respiratory infections, sinusitis) and for      chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes, asthma).          The Cave Grouper™ is the oldest and most established grouper of      episodes-of-care in the market today. The first article was published in      1992 based on work formed since 1989. Over the past 22 years,      derivations of the Cave Grouper™ have been applied and validated using a      wide variety of study populations totaling over 90 million individuals      and 705,000 physicians. CCGroup has invested significant time and effort      to determine and develop the most appropriate methods to build      episodes-of-care and to obtain reliable, stable provider efficiency      scores, especially the method on using a predefined set of medical      conditions for a specialty type.     “CCGroup is proud to be the first company to release a free      grouper of medical condition episodes to the public,” stated Dr.      Douglas G. Cave, President of CCGroup. “This is a key phase to allow      all of CCGroup’s methods and algorithms to be 100% transparent for      public use – including health plans, health systems, and the Federal and      State governments.”          CaveGrouper-Lite™ has been successfully downloaded a significant number      of times – and the downloads continue. Dr.      John Rootenberg, SVP of Clinical Strategy, affirmed the following      percentage breakdown by entity type. “20% of downloads were from health      plans; 16% from healthcare consulting firms; 15% from physician groups;      14% from hospital-based health systems; 14% from academic universities      and research organizations; 9% from healthcare software vendors; 4% for      State and Federal Government agencies (such as the Centers for Medicare      and Medicaid Services); 4% from pharmaceutical/biotech companies; 2%      from potential competitors to CCGroup; and 2% from all other.”          A main reason stated for downloading CaveGrouper-Lite™ continues to be      the new Accountable Care Organization (ACO) and Patient      Centered Medical Home (PCMH) legislation. “The      CaveGrouper-Lite™ is essential for consistent episode-of-care analytics      and performance measurement,” stated Dr. Cave. “For resource      planning purposes, clinical leaders need to gain a complete view of the      medical condition prevalence of their covered population base. In this      manner, healthcare resource needs may be adjusted with changes in the      condition-specific prevalence rates.”          Other common reasons stated for downloading CaveGrouper-Lite™ included      the following. Clinical leaders stated they need to track medical      condition episodes-of-care to physicians and compare their average costs      and utilization patterns to one another and to CCGroup’s national      comparative database. Also, under the CMS Bundled Payments initiative,      the episodes-of-care may be used by clinical leaders to examine possible      bundled payment models.          Dr. Cave stated, “A key foundation for accountable performance      measurement is the CaveGrouper-Lite™ because the methods and algorithms      are 100% transparent, free to the public, and tested and validated on      all study populations.”     Download      the CaveGrouper-Lite™  About Cave Consulting Group, Inc.

IMFs Lagarde warns on upbeat Europe markets#Markets might be too optimistic on the euro zones prospects,  according to the Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the  International Monetary Fund (IMF),  who has warned that large amounts of debt, unemployment and low  inflation could hit growth in the region. Speaking at an event in the Robert Schuman Foundation in  Paris, she said that Europe continues to face important  challenges concerning its long-term future and markets might be  at risk of being too complacent. The good news is that the European economy is recovering  from the crisis. Confidence is improving and financial markets  are upbeat. Perhaps too upbeat, she said.

A.M. Best Assigns Rating to WellPoint, Inc.’s New Senior Convertible#OLDWICK, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--      A.M. Best Co. has assigned a debt rating of “bbb+” to the $1.35      billion 2.75% senior convertible debentures due 2042 recently issued by WellPoint,      Inc. (WellPoint) (Indianapolis, IN) [NYSE: WLP]. The rating has been      placed under review with negative implications, which is consistent with      the under review status of the existing ratings of WellPoint and its      insurance subsidiaries. (See A.M. Best’s press release dated July 10,      2012 for further information.)          The securities are being sold to qualified institutional buyers pursuant      to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. If the initial purchasers      exercise their over-allotment option in full, the net proceeds from the      offering would approach $1.5 billion. WellPoint intends to use up to      $400 million of the net proceeds for common share repurchase and the      remainder for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to      additional share repurchase and debt repayment.          Although WellPoint’s pro forma financial leverage—as well as its      goodwill and intangibles to equity ratio—is somewhat higher than      similarly-rated peers, A.M. Best views somewhat favorably the financial      flexibility afforded by the convertible debentures. Additionally, the      issuance is consistent with A.M. Best’s expectations with respect to      WellPoint’s capital structure incorporating the financing for the      previously announced $5.0 billion (approximate) acquisition of AMERIGROUP      Corporation (Amerigroup).          The Amerigroup acquisition is expected to close by year-end 2012,      subject to state and federal regulatory approvals. WellPoint’s ratings      are anticipated to remain under review pending the completion of the      transaction and A.M. Best’s continuing discussions with management.      However, A.M. Best will continue to monitor WellPoint’s operating      performance, risk-based capitalization at the operating companies and      its capital structure to ensure financial and operating metrics remain      within A.M. Best’s expectations.          The methodology used in determining these ratings is Best’s Credit      Rating Methodology, which provides a comprehensive explanation of A.M.      Best’s rating process and contains the different rating criteria      employed in the rating process. Best’s Credit Rating Methodology can be      found at www.ambest.com/ratings/methodology.

Trader Radar - Tuesday December 2nd#Q: On Fast Money’s trader radar we look at the stock that was lighting up screens across Wall Street. This firm was founded as a mining company in the small town of Two Harbors, Minnesota in 1902. Now its a leading maker of more than 50,000 products, including duct tape, optical film for TVs and Post-It notes. But today, the CEO should have made a note to remind him to hedge overseas exposure, as a stronger dollar is eating away at international sales. Who is it?A: On the trader radar tonight we’re watching 3M ! The maker of the Post-It and Scotch tape was among the most active names on the NYSE today.
Hedge fund manager Mark Spitznagel to advise Rand Paul#Mark Spitznagel, the libertarian hedge fund manager, has a  new part-time job: senior economic advisor  to  campaign for president.  Spitznagel is the founder and chief investment  officer of Universa Investments, a fund that  specializes in protecting investors against sharp market drops, sometimes referred to as Black Swan events. The firm manages about $6 billion in  assets, a sizable figure for the hedge fund industry. I am very grateful to have Mark Spitznagel serve as senior economic advisor to my campaign, Paul, now a U.S. senator from Kentucky, said in a statement. As I  travel across the country, the top concern of the American people  is our failing economy. I believe we can revitalize our economy  by encouraging opportunity and entrepreneurship with lower  taxes, a balanced budget, less Federal Reserve  interventionism, and limited government spending, the candidate said.I  look forward to working alongside Mark to solve our nations  economic problem and to restore the American Dream, he added. Paul, one of the leading contenders for the Republican party nomination, was elected in the Tea Party wave of 2010. Much like his iconic father Ron Paul, Paul has become a libertarian standard-bearer.
Street to take second look at Fed#The Fed will likely remain in the spotlight Thursday as a  handful of secondary data reports are the major events on the  calendar.   I think barring any huge surprise in the jobs data tomorrow, I  think a lot of tomorrow will be spillover from what the Fed had  to say, said Myles Clouston, senior director at Nasdaq Advisory  Services.   My sense is a lot of investors feel like theyre walking on  eggshells right now. Theyre waiting for the next data point to  come out, he said.
Crypto investor who bought Beeples NFT for $69 million says#The buyer of the $69 million NFT by the artist Beeple said he was prepared to bid even higher, since it will be seen by history as the starting point of a new age of digital art.In his first television interview, Vignesh Sundaresan, also known as MetaKovan, told CNBCs Squawk Box that he has no regrets paying $69 million for what many say is simply a JPEG and an hyperlink. He said the rise of nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, herald a new era where technology has allowed artists and collectors around the world to buy and sell art more easily and democratically.This NFT is a significant piece of art history, Sundaresan said. Sometimes these things take some time for everyone to recognize and realize. Im OK with that. I had the opportunity to be part of this very important shift in how art has been perceived for centuries.NFTs have exploded in recent months, as NBA video highlights, memes, digital art and even a tweet sell for six or seven figures. While proponents say NFTs, which assign ownership of any digital asset on the blockchain, will not only change the art world but could be applied to physical goods like homes and property. Sales of NFTs have now topped $500 million, according to many estimates.
Yellen says high stock market value does not mean its#Fed Chair Janet Yellen said current high stock market valuations do not mean the market is overvalued or that a sell-off would pose much risk to the economy or financial system.During her final press briefing on Wednesday, Yellen said when the Fed warns that asset levels are elevated, it means metrics, such as the price-to-earnings ratio for stocks, are on the high end of historical ranges.But economists are not great knowing what appropriate valuations are, she said. We dont have a terrific record. And the fact that those valuations are high doesnt mean that they are necessarily overvalued.Yellen said the low-rate environment is supportive of higher valuations. We are enjoying solid economic growth with low inflation. And the risks to the global economy look more balanced than they have in many years, she said.The Fed assesses whether there would be an economic impact or financial stability concerns if the stock market were to sell off. I think when we look at other indicators of financial stability risks, there is nothing flashing red there or possibly even orange, she said.She said the banking system is more resilient than in the past, and there is not a worrisome buildup in leverage or credit growth at excessive levels.This is something that the FOMC pays attention to, she said, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee. But if you ask me: Is this a significant factor shaping monetary policy now? Well, its on the list of risks. Its not a major factor.
Start Your Engines: Gas Prices Will Rise, Analyst Says#As we head into Memorial Day, drivers are experiencing the  lowest gasoline prices since 2008. So what explains the weakness?  Refiners are running strong, strong demand for gas has yet  to materialize, and supplies outside of the Northeast are good.  Couple that with weak numbers out of China on Monday, and you can  see why demand for crude will be lagging.  I do not foresee low prices all summer long. After all,  demand is expected to increase, and refiner problems are always at  risk of cropping up. But by the same token, I do not see $4 gas on  the horizon. Sure, we might get a few pockets around the country,  but overall, it looks like smooth sailing (or driving).  So what levels am I looking at?  On the downside, I would buy at the $2.75 to $2.70 level.  Indeed, gasoline has found solid support here. And as far as the  upside goes, I would sell out of my position at $2.90.

Musk shakes up SpaceX in race to make satellite launch#SpaceX Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk flew to the Seattle area in June for meetings with engineers leading a satellite launch project crucial to his space companys growth.Within hours of landing, Musk had fired at least seven members of the programs senior management team at the Redmond, Washington, office, the culmination of disagreements over the pace at which the team was developing and testing its Starlink satellites, according to the two SpaceX employees with direct knowledge of the situation.Known for pushing aggressive deadlines, Musk quickly brought in new managers from SpaceX headquarters in California to replace a number of the managers he fired. Their mandate: Launch SpaceXs first batch of U.S.-made satellites by the middle of next year, the sources said.The management shakeup and the launch timeline, previously unreported, illustrate how quickly Musk wants to bring online SpaceXs Starlink program, which is competing with OneWeb and Canadas Telesat to be first to market with a new satellite-based Internet service.Those services - essentially a constellation of satellites that will bring high-speed Internet to rural and suburban locations globally - are key to generating the cash that privately-held SpaceX needs to fund Musks real dream of developing a new rocket capable of flying paying customers to the moon and eventually trying to colonize Mars.It would be like rebuilding the Internet in space, Musk told an audience in 2015 when he unveiled Starlink. The goal would be to have a majority of long-distance Internet traffic go over this network.But the program is struggling to hire and retain staff, the employees said. Currently, about 300 SpaceX employees work on Starlink in Redmond, the sources said. According to GeekWire, Musk said in 2015 the Redmond operation would have probably several hundred people, maybe a thousand people after 3-4 years in operation.So far this year, about 50 employees left the company on their own accord, one of the SpaceX employees said, though the reason for those departures was unclear. Overall, SpaceX employs more than 6,000 staff.As of Tuesday, there were 22 job openings — including a job making espresso drinks — for the Redmond office, according to SpaceXs website.SpaceX spokeswoman Eva Behrend told Reuters the Redmond office remains an essential part of the companys efforts to build a next-generation satellite network.Given the success of our recent Starlink demonstration satellites, we have incorporated lessons learned and re-organized to allow for the next design iteration to be flown in short order, Behrend said.She had no further comment on the reorganization or the launch window, but noted the strategy was similar to the rapid iteration in design and testing which led to the success of its rockets.Among the managers fired from the Redmond office was SpaceX Vice President of Satellites Rajeev Badyal, an engineering and hardware veteran of Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, and top designer Mark Krebs, who worked in Googles satellite and aircraft division, the employees said. Krebs declined to comment, and Badyal did not respond to requests for comment.The management shakeup followed in-fighting over pressure from Musk to speed up satellite testing schedules, one of the sources said. SpaceXs Behrend offered no comment on the matter.Culture was also a challenge for recent hires, a second source said. A number of the managers had been hired from nearby technology giant Microsoft, where workers were more accustomed to longer development schedules than Musks famously short deadlines. Another senior manager that left SpaceX was Kim Schulze, who was previously a development manager at Microsoft, one of the people said.

Hillary Clinton to add Jacob Leibenluft, Obamas long-time economic advisor,#One of President Barack Obamas economic advisors will join Hillary  Clintons campaign in another sign of close coordination between  the White House and the presumptive Democratic nominee.  Jacob Leibenluft, deputy director of the National Economic  Council, will become a senior policy advisor as Clinton prepares  to fill out her economic agenda for the general election.  On Tuesday, she plans to deliver a speech in Columbus, Ohio, that  will contrast her proposals to lift middle-class incomes with  Donald Trumps business record, which she will argue is  characterized by self-interest at the expense of others.  Leibenluft has served on Obamas economic team from the beginning  of the presidents first term. Among his areas of focus have been  policies on job training, apprenticeships and the minimum wage.  Jared Bernstein, a former administration colleague, described  Leibenluft as a very strong, fact-based analyst. He joins a  Clinton team that includes other ex-White House aides such as  campaign chairman John Podesta and communications director  Jennifer Palmieri.
Why the Cyprus Solution Will Hurt Market Stability#What appears to be the final resolution of  the crisis in Cyprus may not be perfect but it does not stray  that far from the approach advocated here  and on The Wall Street Journals editorial page last week.  But a good resolution of the Cyprus crisis may not be  enough to undo the damage from interventions that are not based  on clearly stated diagnoses or predictable frameworks for  government actions.

Heres how Snap could survive Facebooks endless copying#Snaps marketing savvy, creativity and understanding of its users will help it survive Facebooks many efforts to kill it by imitation, tech veteran Rahul Sood told CNBC.Snap understands their audience better than anybody, said Sood, chief executive officer of e-sports betting start-up Unikrn and creator of Microsoft Ventures. For example, over spring break at the Las Vegas MGM Hotel and Casino, the company installed a kiosk selling Snap Spectacles. These guys are hardcore marketers, Sood said on Squawk Alley. Facebook launched three new Snap-like features Tuesday morning — the fourth time Facebook has cloned Snapchat features in less than a year — sending Snap shares down more than 4 percent.Facebooks big advantage is that it can reach users outside of Snaps relatively narrow demographic and show off features they may never have tried, Sood said Tuesday. It gives the an opportunity to play with it and use it, he said.However, he added, what works for Snapchat doesnt always work on Facebooks apps.Instagram tried it with their Stories, and it feels sort of like an after-thought, like a bolt-on feature to Instagram, he said. I dont get it, to be honest.

I think that the U.S. real estate will continue to be that safe haven and that the Chinese will always look into it.

Yoshikami: Paulson sold gold? So what!#After months of reading headlines that John Paulsons  perspective on gold had not changed, we suddenly read that he had cut  his holdings significantly.  Just three months ago, he was quoted as saying that his thesis  remains intact, but then we find that Paulson tactically adjusted his  portfolios and reduced his gold position. What gives?  While one might be tempted to conjure up scenarios where words do  not match actions, we think its more a function of examining  current conditions and making a new decision. And that is the  risk associated with reading headlines and making investment  decisions based on the latest comments from anyone: Those  opinions can change, and they often do.  The market is quite irrational. Gold has become the flag  bearer for an environment with less predictability. Gold used to  be a fairly predictable trade against inflation and volatility.  Now gold trades based on Federal  Reserve comments, interest rates, fear, hedge fund liquidity  needs, etc.

Say Goodbye to ATM Fees#ATM fees have always been one of our pet peeves here at OTM. There aren’t many things in this life more frustrating that being charged for the privilege of taking out money from a machine. Just this past weekend, your web producer found himself in need of a quick $20 without a Chase bank in sight – next thing he knew he’s coughing up $3 in fees at a Citibank machine, not to mention another $2 on top of that from Chase (thanks for that!). The easiest thing you can do to avoid these nasty fees is to only use ATMs from your bank, obviously. But sometimes you’ll be in a pinch and there just won’t be any around. This is when Greg McBridge, senior financial analyst for , suggests ducking in to a store and using your debit card to get cash back at the point of sale. This is tantamount to making an ATM withdrawal, without the fee. Go to your banks web site to see where their machines are. If theyre sparse, pick up the phone and ask if the bank participates in surcharge-free networks like Allpoint, Moneypass or AllianceOne, which allow customers of participating banks to make withdrawals from a large stable of ATMs without fees. Bottom line? If you find yourself paying a fee every once and a while, it won’t bankrupt you. But if you’re being charged fees on the regular, it’s time to figure out a new way to access your cash.

More Coming from the Real Time Front#Okay I would like to share some more good news for you stockaholics. Our real-time Nasdaq quotes were so popular with many of you, we decided to turn on the NYSE quotes as well. Now you will get up to the second trading data on blue chip stocks like AT&T, General Motors, and General Electric (my corporate overlord) along with the real-time quotes were giving on Nasdaq stocks like Microsoft and Google. Now this added NYSE real-time data comes through Nasdaq as well. We figured, since we were already getting the Nasdaq quotes through that exchange, we may as well give you the data on NYSE stocks traded through Nasdaq as well. Since Nasdaq is handling a substantial number of trades for NYSE based stocks, the quotes from the Nasdaq track pretty closely with quotes from the NYSE. And of course the quotes from the NYSE are available, on a delayed basis, as well. Were just trying to give you the best information available. As always, we may be making added tweaks down the road.

BNP Paribas gets retail bank boost but trading lags#BNP Paribas, the French bank, became the latest big European bank  to report profits fell at its investment bank on Friday, as it  was boosted overall by profits in its retail division.  Its net profit rose to 1.83 billion euros ($2.01 billion) in the  three months to the end of September, up 15 percent from the same  time in 2014. However, this reflected a much healthier picture at  its retail bank, where increased loan demand helped drive up total pretax profit by 5 percent to 979 million euros.
Buffalo Wild Wings execs have not put their money where#Activist hedge fund manager Mick McGuire is lobbying for changes at popular wing restaurant Buffalo Wild Wings.McGuire, who runs Marcato Capital Management, has been pushing for the company to franchise more of its restaurants since July and even nominated four directors to the companys board in February. On Wednesday, McGuire once again took aim at Buffalo Wild Wings, publishing a presentation for investors that argued the executives interests were not closely aligned with the wing chains shareholders.Since its IPO in 2003, Buffalo Wild Wings Board and Management team have sold the vast majority of all stock ever owned, McGuire said in a statement. In our view, this lack of long-term ownership has contributed to failures of governance and oversight, poor capital allocation discipline and the severe lack of urgency in navigating the difficult operating environment. Shareholders deserve a Board and management team that is willing to commit its own capital alongside them.McGuire noted that none of the Buffalo Wild Wings executives currently owns shares in the company and only one director has ever executed an open-market purchase of the stock. He also argued that B-Dubs management team has been using equity incentive plans to purchase shares at a lower price and then sell them on the market to make cash.Buffalo Wild Wings leadership has not put their money where their mouth is, McGuire said.Buffalo Wild Wings responded by saying that its directors interests are closely aligned with those of its shareholders, noting that its team owns significant equity interests in the company. Virtually all trading of the companys common stock owned by management — who receive approximately half of their compensation in performance-based stock awards — is executed under preexisting plans that are commonly adopted for personal financial planning purposes, the company said in a statement. Marcato owns 5.6 percent of the company and is hoping to get McGuire and three other nominated directors onto the board.The other nominees are Scott Bergren, former CEO of Yum Brands, Sam Rovit, who has 20 years of experience in the food service industry and Lee Sanders, who held leadership roles at TGI Fridays and Johnny Rockets. In February, when the directors were proposed, Buffalo Wild Wings said it would evaluate the nominees independently.Buffalo Wild Wings also took issue with Marcatos characterization of its stock performance, saying in the last five years, its shares appreciated more than 80 percent and rose more than 470 percent over the last 10 years. We believe the stock performance is compelling evidence of the effectiveness of the board and management, and their focus on the creation of long-term shareholder value, the company said.
New evacuations near Guatemala volcano set off panic#Frightened people living near the Volcano of Fire fled with their children and few possessions when fresh flows of super-heated debris were announced, taking no chances after authorities gave them little time to evacuate before a deadly eruption over the weekend.Traffic came to a standstill on choked roads Tuesday and those without vehicles walked, even in central Escuintla, which was not under an evacuation order. Businesses shuttered as owners fled, memories still fresh of Sundays blast, which left at least 75 people dead and 192 missing, and reduced a once verdant area to a moonscape of ash.Mirna Priz, who sells tamales and chiles rellenos, wept as she sat on a rock at a crossroads, with a suitcase in front of her and her 11-year-old son, Allen, and their terrier mix Cara Sucia by her side.You feel powerless, she said. I dont know where Im going to go. To leave my things, everything I have.But after seeing what happened Sunday, she was afraid to stay.A column of smoke rose from the mountain Tuesday afternoon and hot volcanic material began descending its south side, prompting new evacuation orders for a half dozen communities and the closure of a national highway. The countrys seismology and vulcanology institute said the smoke billowing from the volcanos top could produce a curtain of ash that could reach 20,000 feet (6,000 meters) above sea level, posing a danger to air traffic.Rescuers, police and journalists hurried to leave the area as a siren wailed and loudspeakers blared, Evacuate!

US court upholds Obama-era retirement advice rule#A U.S. federal judge on Wednesday upheld an Obama-era rule designed to avoid conflicts of interests when brokers give retirement advice, in a possible setback for President Donald Trumps efforts to scale back government regulation.The stinging 81-page ruling comes just days after Trump ordered the Labor Department to review the fiduciary rule — a move widely interpreted as an effort to delay or kill the regulation.The decision by Chief Judge Barbara Lynn for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas is a stunning defeat for the business and financial services industry groups that had sought to overturn it.And while it is not expected to stop the Labor Department from delaying the rules April 10 compliance deadline while it conducts the review, some legal experts say it could make it more difficult for the Labor Department to find a way to justify scrapping or significantly altering the rule.This marks the second time now a federal district court has upheld the fiduciary rule. A third court, meanwhile, rejected an effort to stay the rules implementation.Three courts have now carefully considered the full range of industry attacks on the DOLs best interest fiduciary rule, and they have firmly rejected all of them, said Stephen Hall, the legal director of Better Markets, a non-profit group that supports the rule.The decision issued today is definitive and sends a message that ought to put a stake through the heart of industrys efforts to destroy this common-sense rule.The Labor Departments fiduciary rule requires brokers to put their clients best interests first when advising them about individual retirement accounts or 401(k) retirement plans.It is championed by consumer advocates and retirement non-profit groups, but has been staunchly opposed by the financial services sector, which argues it will make retirement advice too costly and harm lower-income retirees in particular.The long list of groups that sued the Labor Department in the Dallas federal court include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Financial Services Institute, the Financial Services Roundtable, the Insured Retirement Institute and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.In a joint statement, those groups said they disagreed with the judges ruling and vowed to pursue all of our available options to see that this rule is rescinded.The decision in the Labor Departments favor came just a few hours after the Justice Department had petitioned the court to stay issuing a ruling because of the Feb. 3 White House request to review the rule to determine if it should be revised or scrapped.Lynn, who was appointed to the bench by former President Bill Clinton, denied that request shortly after her ruling was filed.The Department of Labor is continuing to follow the presidents memorandum and is exploring options to delay the applicability date, Labor Department spokeswoman Jillian Rogers said in a statement.Sweeping legal arguments rejectedWednesdays ruling represents a setback for Gibson Dunn & Crutcher attorney Eugene Scalia, who represented the business groups and has a strong track record for winning legal challenges to kill off unwanted Wall Street regulations.The decision addressed a sweeping series of legal arguments that Gibson Dunns attorneys made against the rule, including claims that the Labor Department had exceeded its legal authority and that it had violated federal rulemaking procedures by failing to conduct an adequate cost-benefit analysis to help justify the regulation.The court finds the DOL adequately weighed the monetary and non-monetary costs on the industry of complying with the rules, against the benefits to consumers, Lynn wrote.In doing so, the DOL conducted a reasonable cost-benefit analysis.Lynn also rejected other arguments, including claims that the rule violated free speech rights of brokers and that the rule violated federal laws governing arbitration.The case could still be appealed to a higher court.Meanwhile, there are still several other pending legal challenges to the rule.
Why Trump&rsquo;s rigged-election claim is likely to backfire#The news cycle has been largely dominated by Republican presidential nominee  Donald Trumps assertion that the election process is rigged against him.     Trump has repeatedly made this claim since mid-summer, and it was an important topic at the last presidential debate.  But will this help his public standing or create ill-will?  Ive studied and written about excuses and blame, and we know a fair amount about when excuses work and when they will likely backfire.    Making excuses is part of human nature.  People tend to care deeply about what others think of them, and excuses are a way of managing others opinions.     The rigged election claim is a particular type of excuse called self-handicapping.  Excuses are generally offered after a problem occurs.  In contrast, self-handicaps are excuses offered before an event.  The idea is that by shaping expectations, one will be held less accountable in the event that things go poorly.   An example is a student telling her mother Hey, dont expect me to do well on the test today.  The teacher is terrible, he hasnt done a good job explaining the material.  If the student does poorly on the test, she has deflected blame away from herself and on the teacher and hopefully mom wont be as angry because of the pre-emptive strike.       There is another potential benefit to self-handicapping.  If one offers a self-handicap and succeeds in spite of the impediment, heroes are born.  Think of the famous Michael Jordan flu game in the 1997 NBA finals.  Everybody knew that Jordan was very ill and that the chances of a typical Jordan performance were slim because of his health.  If he had a bad game, nobody would have changed their opinion of him because after all, he was really sick.  But Jordan overcame his illness and had one of his most memorable games, scoring 38 points and cementing his legend.   Donald Trumps rigged-election claim is classic self-handicapping. However, its important to note that successfully self-handicapping hinges on credibility and believability.    People will evaluate the sincerity of the person delivering the excuse and the plausibility of the excuse itself. People are uncomfortable when they believe that someone is trying to manipulate them. And, if someone has a pattern of making excuses rather than accepting responsibility, it is more difficult to believe the most recent explanation.     Think back to Trumps explanations for his performance in the earlier debates.  He blamed his performance at the Sept. 26 debate in part on a bad microphone that was not noticed by anyone other than the candidate.  The Oct. 9 debate included several complaints about biased moderators, including remarking that it was one on three.     The credibility of the messenger and the message, based in part on the frequency of the rigged-election claim and past excuses, should be concerns for the Trump camp in predicting public reaction to the rigged-election claims.            Many have grown weary of the tone of the campaign rhetoric, which will affect how voters interpret future remarks from both major-party candidates.  Trumps core followers will no doubt accept the rigged election claim as gospel, believing that if he loses, it is because of an unfair process and therefore not Trumps fault.  And if he wins, then he is a hero for overcoming the bias.     However, issues with the credibility and frequency of the claims, along with what some may interpret as their self-serving nature, will likely backfire with many voters.  It doesnt appear that these remarks are designed to spur a change in the election process as much as to protect future reputation.  Self-handicapping can be an effective impression-management strategy, but may also have unintended repercussions.    The rigged-election claim was intended to diminish personal blame if he loses the election.  Instead, he likely will alienate more voters because they dont like being manipulated.    Commentary by J.

MerchantCashAdvanceIndustry.org Offers Business Loan Solutions to Those Affected by Hurricane#NEW YORK, Nov. 2, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- The MerchantCashAdvanceIndustry.org network, a lending portal for small and mid-sized businesses has initiated a recovery campaign with its partners in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. The call to action was driven by witnessing the aftermath firsthand near their office in New York City. A spokesperson for the network was quoted as saying, We fear that access to traditional forms of financing will be full of red tape, considering that banks today are already highly risk averse. The additional uncertainty brought on by the disaster, whether businesses were directly affected by it or not could very well lead to fewer loans and lines of credit. We feel it more necessary than ever to spread the message that alternatives like merchant cash advances, cash flow loans, and other forms of merchant financing are accessible.A merchant cash advance allows businesses to tap into their projected future revenues today by literally selling a fixed portion of those future sales to a factoring company.Cash flow loans allow businesses to leverage their historical revenues and positive cash flow to get approved for a short-term business loan. Accepting credit cards as a form of payment is not necessary for consideration.Approval and funding is typically completed in less than a week. Applicants operating an existing business in a Hurricane affected area can request an even further expedited application process by checking the designated box on the websites inquiry forms.MerchantCashAdvanceIndustry.org makes no guarantee of loan approval, is not offering grants, and is not involved in any type of governmental assistance program.

Ads Posted on Facebook Strike Some as Off-Key#Facebook, the world’s biggest social network, is selling more ad spots to big companies like Wal-Mart Stores, Procter & Gamble and PepsiCo.But the site’s pages are also home to countless ads from smaller companies that can be funny, weird or just plain creepy — those suggesting you are, say, eligible to get a free iPad because you are exactly 26 years old, or entreaties to see what your offspring would look like if you had a child with a celebrity.Odd Web ads, like the dancing women promoting mortgage brokers, are not new. But on social networks like Facebook, where people go to communicate with one another, advertisers seem to be trying especially hard to intrude on the conversation.
JPMorgan Discovers Further Cyber Security Issues#For the second time in roughly three  months, JPMorgan Chase is  scrambling to contain the fallout from a security breach of its  vast computer network, according to several people with knowledge  of the investigation. JPMorgan, the nations largest bank, recently found that  hackers, with links to Italy or southern Europe, had gained entry  to some of the banks servers, these people said. Read MoreJPMorgan:We are not aware of a new cyberattack The discovery follows an attack that was uncovered in late  July and suggests that it was more extensive than first thought.  In that attack, hackers obtained entry to dozens of the banks  servers and reviewed information on more than one million  customer accounts. Security experts briefed on the matter had  said that the full extent of the July attack was not known and  that it could take the bank months to discover all of the  fallout.

Legere: Why T-Mobile resonates with millennials#One of the key factors playing a key role in T-Mobiles success  is its appeal to millennials because of the freedom it  provides, the companys CEO, John Legere, said Tuesday.  Overall, weve done nine uncarrier moves. An uncarrier move  is a move intended to change a stupid, broken arrogant industry,  and its intended to be permanent, and we want everybody to  change [to] no contracts, anytime upgrades and international data  roaming, Legere told CNBCs Squawk  Alley. This freedom resonates with young folks.  Legere made his remarks after the company said it added nearly 2  million subscribers in the first quarter of 2015, marking the  eighth-consecutive quarter in which the company added over 1  million users. T-Mobile also  reported total revenue of $7.8 billion in the quarter, a  13.1 percent rise year-over-year.  Legere added that the company will continue growing as awareness  of the companys freedoms grows. Between 10 and 28 percent  … those are the awareness levels among wireless  subscribers of the changes weve made. When somebody goes  overseas and sees that international roaming is free, they say,  Youre kidding me. I didnt know that,  he said.Read More  T-Mobile CEO: Not afraid of the competition  T-Mobiles stock was up in midday trading. Click here to see where the stock is trading now.
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard sues Hillary Clinton for alleged Russian asset#Democratic presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard sued former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Wednesday for allegedly defaming her by suggesting the Hawaii congresswoman is a Russian asset.Clintons false assertions were made in a deliberate attempt to derail Tulsis campaign, said the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.The suit claims that Gabbard has suffered actual damages of $50 million — and counting from Clintons comments. But the suit does not cite a specific amount of damages it is seeking.Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee who previously was a senator from New York, said in an October interview that an unnamed Democratic presidential candidate was the favorite of the Russians.Clinton did not mention Gabbard, a four-term congresswoman, by name in that interview with the podcast Campaign HQ With David Plouffe.But Clintons spokesman, Nick Merrill, said after the interview that If the nesting doll fits, when asked if she had been referring to Gabbard, who is also a major in the Army National Guard and a combat veteran of Iraq.Merrill later said in a tweet that Clinton was referring to the Republican Party grooming Gabbard. But it is Russians, not the GOP, who are known for making nesting, or Matryoshka dolls.Clinton, wife of President Bill Clinton, lost the 2016 election to Republican nominee Donald Trump.The report by special counsel Robert Mueller as well as a probe by the Senate Intelligence Committee have both found that Russian agents tried to damage Clintons candidacy, and that they tried to promote the third-party candidacy of Green Party nominee Jill Stein in order to harm Clintons chances of winning the White House.
DigitalOcean emphasizes simplicity in IPO filing as it prepares to#The market for cloud-computing infrastructure to power applications has grown immensely since Amazon introduced its first cloud services in 2006, but U.S. investors havent had a great way of investing exclusively in cloud. That will change in the coming weeks when a company called DigitalOcean starts trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol DOCN.Buying shares of Amazon -- or Alibaba, Google, IBM, Microsoft or Oracle -- has meant getting a small percentage of exposure to the public cloud. DigitalOcean is different because it doesnt do anything else.The company will start out with a much lower valuation than those other companies. In a Monday update to the prospectus for its initial public offering, DigitalOcean said it expects to sell shares at $44 to $47 per share, which would give it a market cap of about $4.8 billion at the middle of the range. DigitalOcean also said Tiger Global and an entity tied to existing investor Access Industries want to buy up to $175 million in the companys shares at the time of the IPO.Unlike public cloud market leader Amazon Web Services, DigitalOcean is not profitable. It lost almost $44 million in 2020, compared with a $40 million loss in 2019. DigitalOcean is also growing more slowly than AWS, despite that AWS generates 142 times more revenue. AWS revenue in 2020 totaled $45.37 billion, up 29.5%, while DigitalOcean reported 25% revenue growth.That might be okay, because DigitalOcean has a specialty: Simplicity. It isnt overwhelming to new users, who wind up increasing the amount they spend on DigitalOcean services over time.Simplicity is one of the four principles the founders picked when DigitalOcean started in 2012. We take infrastructure technology and make it simple across all aspects of the product experience, CEO Yancey Spruill, a former operating chief and finance chief at SendGrid, wrote in a letter to investors in the prospectus.
Ford, Amazon, Subway and History Channel Generate Most Buzz#Ford, Amazon, Subway and the History Channel  are the  buzziest brands in the United States, according to the latest  bi-annual list from YouGovs BrandIndex.

Trump lawyer Giuliani was paid $500,000 to consult on indicted#President Donald Trumps personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, was paid $500,000 for work he did for a company co-founded by the Ukrainian-American businessman arrested last week on campaign finance charges, Giuliani told Reuters on Monday.The businessman, Lev Parnas, is a close associate of Giuliani and was involved in his effort to investigate Trumps political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, who is a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic Party nomination.Giuliani said Parnas company, Boca Raton, Florida-based Fraud Guarantee, whose website says it aims to help clients reduce and mitigate fraud, engaged Giuliani Partners, a management and security consulting firm, around August 2018. Giuliani said he was hired to consult on Fraud Guarantees technologies and provide legal advice on regulatory issues.Federal prosecutors are examining Giulianis interactions with Parnas and another Giuliani associate, Igor Fruman, who was also indicted on campaign finance charges, a law enforcement source told Reuters on Sunday.The New York Times reported last week that Parnas had told associates he paid Giuliani hundreds of thousands of dollars for what Giuliani said was business and legal advice. Giuliani said for the first time on Monday that the total amount was $500,000.Giuliani told Reuters the money came in two payments made within weeks of each other. He said he could not recall the dates of the payments. He said most of the work he did for Fraud Guarantee was completed in 2018 but that he had been doing follow-up for over a year.Parnas and Fruman were arrested at Dulles Airport outside Washington last week on charges they funneled foreign money to unnamed U.S. politicians in a bid to influence U.S.-Ukraine relations in violation of U.S. campaign finance laws. The men were preparing to board a plane to Europe.According to an indictment unsealed by U.S. prosecutors, an unidentified Russian businessman arranged for two $500,000 wires to be sent from foreign bank accounts to a U.S. account controlled by Fruman in September and October 2018. The money was used, in part, by Fruman, Parnas and two other men charged in the indictment to gain influence with U.S. politicians and candidates, the indictment said.Foreign nationals are prohibited from making contributions and other expenditures in connection with U.S. elections, and from making contributions in someone elses name.Giuliani said he was confident that the money he received was from a domestic source, but he would not say where it came from.I know beyond any doubt the source of the money is not any questionable source, he told Reuters in an interview. The money did not come from foreigners. I can rule that out 100%, he said.He declined to say whether the money had been paid directly to him by Fraud Guarantee or from another source.John Dowd, a lawyer for Parnas and Fruman, also would not discuss the source of the funding that Giuliani said he received for his work for Fraud Guarantee. What I know is privileged, Dowd said.
Jack Bogle bashes FANG investing, says this trading mentality is#Vanguard founder and former CEO Jack Bogle is not a believer in trading FANG stocks.When asked about Intercontinental Exchange launching a FANG+ index futures contract for traders on Wednesday, Bogle blasted the idea.The product enables investors to trade an index that tracks the performance of Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google-parent Alphabet, along with Alibaba, Baidu, Nvidia, Tesla and Twitter.If you want to do such a crazy thing, it certainly makes it easy to do. ... I have no doubt its a liability, Bogle said on CNBCs Power Lunch Tuesday. I think the odds are very bad. It appeals to the trading instincts in investors. ... If you like gambling, if you like casinos, these things are really, really, really good.Instead he recommended investors focus on the long term with a multidecade time horizon by buying index funds that minimize trading transaction costs.  Anything that gets investors into trading is a negative, he said. Trading is a losers game. Trading is short term speculation.Bogle founded Vanguard Group in 1975. The firm is widely regarded as the leader of passive index investing. It has approximately $4.7 trillion in assets under management, according to its president.
Dow posts 6-day losing streak as media stocks plunge; jobs#U.S. stocks closed lower on Thursday, with the Nasdaq off 1.6  percent, as investors weighed declines in oil and disappointing  earnings ahead of Fridays key employment report. (Tweet This)  Theres nervousness among momentum investors caused by some of  the outperforming names either missing or giving cautious  comments in earnings reports, said Robert Pavlik, chief market  strategist at Boston Private Wealth.   I dont think much of it is warranted, he said, noting some  profit-taking.   The major averages came off session lows in the close. The Dow  Jones industrial average ended at its lowest level in 6 months  and posted its first 6-day losing streak since October.  Stocks extended losses in midday trade as the S&P 500 broke  through a key level of 2,087 that many analysts were watching.  The index closed below that level but held above its 200-day  moving average of 2,072.   Art Cashin, director of floor operations at UBS, said the next  level of support is 2,063 to 2,067.   Viacom and 21st Century Fox plunged, joining Disney in a  post-earnings stock decline to bring the media sector down about  8 percent for the week so far. At its lows the media sector was  off about 11 percent for the week, on track for its worst week since October  2008, when it lost 21.87 percent.   The media sector weighed on consumer discretionary, off more than  1 percent as one of the greatest decliners in the S&P  500.  Read MoreAmid media carnage,  opportunities may abound  Health care was the worst sector performer, falling more than 2  percent as biotechs plunged. The declines weighed heavily on the  Nasdaq, which closed more than 1.5 percent lower.  The iShares Nasdaq  biotechnology ETF (IBB) fell 4.3 percent,  while Apple reversed recent declines to end mildly  higher.   The Dow Jones industrial average closed about 120 points lower,  after falling as much as 177 points.   The greatest weight on the index was Disney, which closed 1.8 percent lower,  off an earlier 5.5 percent decline. The stock extended its  post-earnings plunge from Wednesday after the firm missed on  revenue and disappointed investors with subscriber losses.  Year-to-date, the stock is the third-best performer in the Dow.  Youve got some nervousness ahead of the jobs report, lack of a  bullish impetus, narrowing leadership, said Adam Sarhan, CEO of  Sarhan Capital. The market continues to get weaker, not  stronger.   He is watching 2,040 on the S&P 500. Right now therere less  and less bullish drivers and concurrently more bearish drivers,  Sarhan said. If support breaks theres no question on my mind  (that we get a correction).   Market participants are really groping for a new catalyst to  move stocks higher, said Mark Luschini, chief investment  strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. Theres still some  questions on the economy, the pace of growth.   He noted there were few indications that the market was strongly  concerned about an interest rate hike, as bond yields held lower,  the dollar was flat, and gold traded a touch higher.   The rise in the Treasury market is a take of two separate things  moving in different directions, said Eric Stein, co-director of global fixed income at Eaton Vance Management. He noted hawkish comments from policymakers balanced by the continued selloff in commodity prices. Its not all about September, its obviously about the path of rates (in the next) two to three years, Stein said. Fridays jobs report is one of the few key pieces of data expected before the Federal Reserve meets in September and could potentially find enough impetus for raising short-term interest rates. Economists expect 223,000 nonfarm payrolls on Friday, with  unemployment unchanged at 5.3 percent, according to Thomson  Reuters.  I think this (jobs) report is what everyones keying on. Weve  kind of got mixed messages in the data this week, said Chris  Gaffney, president of EverBank World Markets.   I think the key is average hourly earnings and if that comes  with a 2 percent increase tomorrow, absolutely September comes  into play, Gaffney said.  Read MoreEarnings? Who cares.  All eyes are on Jobs Friday  I think the market is really getting anxious about nonfarm  payrolls, said Doug Cote, chief market strategist at Voya  Investment Management. If its a moderate number, then (liftoff)  could be put off, but if its a really big number  tomorrow—if unemployment is 5.2 percent—the market  struggles a little bit, raise the prospect of a September rate  increase.  Jobs data so far this week was mixed. Initial claims came in Thursday  at 270,000, slightly below expectations. The private sector  report from ADP showed fewer-than-expected jobs were created. U.S. job cuts in July  exceeded 100,000 for the first time in nearly four years as the  military announced plans to reduce troop and civilian  workforce payrolls, according to Challenger, Gray &  Christmas. A year ago, U.S. companies announced plans to cut  46,887 jobs.  However, the major jump in job cuts is not expected to  significantly affect Fridays key report.  We think this increase in announced job cuts will have no impact  on the July BLS report, and only a minimal impact on the  employment data over the next few years. The jump in layoffs  announced in July was basically entirely due to reductions  announced by the US Army that are scheduled to begin in October  and be implemented over the next two years, JPMorgan said in a  morning note.
Valuations too much, even for Amazon?#With shares up more than 40% ytd and a valuation of 131 times  2014 earnings, is the Amazon premium too great – even for  Amazon? The stock just made a new all time high!Thats the question on the minds of many investors after Amazon  shares surged over 8% on better than expected earnings.The numbers were good – but were they that good?Revenue increased 24 percent to $17.09 billion from $13.81  billion a year ago.Meanwhile, the companys net loss dropped to $41 million, or 9  cents per share, from a loss of $274 million, 60 cents per share,  the year-earlier period.Thats right – this sky high valuation is for a company that  posted a loss.I hear people speak of how horrendous this all ends, and how  there has to be a moment where shares tumble precipitously,  Cramer mused.

Dick Grasso: $4T question nobody is asking the Fed#With all the talk about when the Federal Reserve might increase interest rates, former New  York Stock Exchange chief Dick Grasso said Wednesday hes  concerned about how the central bank plans to reduce its $4.4  trillion balance sheet.  The question nobody seems to be asking the Fed, according to Grasso: How are you going to do  that in the context of everyone else in the world stimulating  [and] lowering rates—applying, if you will, the type of  stimulus we applied.  The total assets of the Fed have increased  from about $869 billion in August 2007, during three rounds of  quantitative easing bond purchases  that started in November 2008 in an effort to support the economy  and combat the effects of the financial crisis.  Former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke argued at an event last month  the central bank could maintain its balance sheet at somewhat  higher amounts than precrisis levels. Read MoreDont expect rate  riot: Roubini  Some Fed watchers see perhaps $1.2 trillion to $1.3 trillion as a  new sweet spot, once the unwinding is complete.  Four trillion is unprecedented, but to shrink it by two-thirds  you dont have a comparable period in our history, Grasso said  in an interview on CNBCs Squawk  Box.
UConn not planning to name center for Calhoun#HARTFORD, Conn. -- Connecticuts athletic director says the university is looking for a sponsor to step forward and secure the naming rights for its planned basketball training center and has no plans to name the building after newly retired basketball coach Jim Calhoun.Theres not been one point in the conversation about naming the building for Jim, because weve always, since I got here, been talking about the naming opportunity to raise money, said Ward Manuel, who addressed the speculation Monday after Calhoun spoke at a chamber of commerce breakfast in Cromwell.The facility, which is expected to cost more than $40 million, is being funded entirely by private donations.It would be built adjacent to Gampel Pavilion on the site where the former football stadium was razed earlier this year. Plans call for separate practice courts for the mens and womens basketball teams, locker rooms, weight rooms, classrooms, a sports medicine center and offices for the basketball staff.About $22 million of the $32 million needed to break ground on the center, the school said this week.Were more than halfway toward the total and about 75 percent to what we need to start construction, Manuel said.Calhoun, who retired as coach last month, is raising money for the center as part of his new job as a special assistant to Manuel.He said he will be visiting NBA training camps this fall and plans to ask former UConn players for their help with the center, which he said will also celebrate the history of Husky basketball.Some of the kids have expressed some interest, and those who havent are going to become more interested, Calhoun said.Calhoun said hes talked to planners about including a locker room just for basketball alumni, who will be able to use the facility.That in turn, in my opinion, will keep, five years, 10 years, 20, down the line, all those guys connected, he said. And as guys graduate and go on to their careers, obviously they will be able to do more. _ maybe one guy will want a room named after him, etcetera.Earlier this summer, the school announced that Webster Bank had made a significant donation to the building, but would not release the details. Last December, the school announced that a Woodbridge couple, Peter J. and Pamela H. Werth donated $4.5 million for the building, the largest single private gift ever to the Division of Athletics.
Uber fallout: Heres the level to watch as stock falls#Uber could still make a U-turn.Thats according to JC OHara, chief market technician at MKM Partners, who told CNBCs Trading Nation on Friday that breaching one key level could greatly bolster the stocks bull case.Uber shares have endured a great deal of push-and-pull in recent days, sent higher on Friday by positive analyst notes from Stifel and SunTrust, but tipped into a 1% decline on Monday after the city of London stripped the ride-hailing giant of its license to operate there — Ubers biggest European market. The order is on hold as Uber appeals the decision.Looking at Ubers chart since its IPO — which, as of Monday, displayed a painful 36% decline from the debut price — OHara saw some hope for the stock.I can really appreciate this recent short-term positive momentum, especially after we got past the lockup expiration earlier this month, OHara said. Since the  on Nov. 6, current and former insiders including ex-CEO Travis Kalanick,have sold large blocks of shares. But ... if we take a step back and look at the six-month chart, we find that we are still in a defined downtrend, OHara said. We have price trading below a declining 50-day moving average. We have a series of lower highs in place as well as lower lows. So, I think it might be too premature to say the worst is behind us.Still, OHara said one level would determine Ubers ability to turn around.If we do manage to push up and break above the October highs in that $34-35 area, I think I would be a little bit more confident at that point in time that the worst is behind us, and the base suggests that we can move higher at that point, the technical analyst said.Uber shares were just above the $29 level in early Monday trading.Steve Chiavarone, equity strategist, vice president and portfolio manager at Federated, wasnt as confident that Uber could find an upward catalyst.I think scalability is the issue, Chiavarone said in Fridays segment. We focus on incremental margins. Youve got insurance costs here that grow as the company expands, and that raises questions about scalability. So, as we evaluate IPOs, particularly through our Kaufmann Growth franchise, what were looking for is companies that are asset-light, can scale the business and are generating incremental margins. Im not sure we find that here.Chiavarone added that his firm was not yet exposed to the ride-hailing space, citing its stringent guidelines for investing in newly public names.What were looking for are those companies where we can see a clear pathway to cash-flow growth because that ultimately is going to be where the value is, and so we have not played this space, he said.Earlier this year, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi told CNBC that he expected the company to be profitable by 2021.Disclaimer
China Feb inflation +2.3% on-year, fastest rise since July 2014#Consumer prices in the worlds second-largest economy accelerated  to a six-month high in February as seasonal distortions caused  food prices to spike.  Consumer price inflation rose 2.3 percent from a year ago, faster  than Januarys 1.8 percent rise and well above Reuters  expectations for 1.9 percent rise. Februarys expansion was the  fastest annual pace of growth since July 2014, Reuters said.  Februarys spike was only a temporary effect, warned Grace Ng, greater China economist at J.P Morgan.  Part of the increase is due to Chinese New Year-related issues.  Generally, the inflation picture overall is quite tame. For the  whole year, were still looking for inflation below 2 percent,  she told CNBCs Squawk Box.  The week-long Lunar New Year holiday that began on February 7  tends to increase demand for fresh food every year, which pushes up prices. Unusual cold weather this year also caused a tightening in the  supply of vegetables, driving prices higher, according to a  Societe Generale note.  Despite the surge, inflation isnt expected to continue  accelerating.

CCTV Script 26/01/15#— This is the script of CNBCs news report for Chinas CCTV on  January 26, Monday.The risk of a sovereign default in Greece has  increased after the anti-austerity Syriza party won Sundays snap  elections, analysts say, noting that anxiety over the possibility  that Greece will exit the euro zone will keep global markets  nervous. The winning partys leader Alexis Tsipras promised that  five years of austerity, humiliation and suffering imposed by  international creditors were over after his Syriza party swept to  victory in a snap election on Sunday.  [ALEXIS TSIPRAS / SYRIZA PARTY LEADER] Greece is turning a  page, Greece is leaving behind catastrophic austerity, it is  leaving behind the fear and the autocracy, it is leaving behind  five years of humiliation and pain.  Greece owes more than $350 billion to government institutions and  investors. The country also faces a 3.5 billion euro bond coming  due this July and another 3 billion in August. Syriza members  told CNBC on Sunday that the partys top priority is to win a  dramatic easing of its repayment terms.  [Jeff Halley / Saxo Capital Markets] I think they are pretty  high right now. They are above 40% now Looking at some of the  headlines from new PM this morning he was pretty determined and i  think troika era is over for greece. bi-lateral agreement in  place for Greece.  While Tsipras fell just short of an overall majority, he is set  to lead the first euro zone government committed to overturning  the kind of budgetary rigor that was imposed on Greece as a  condition of the bailout in 2010.  [STEFAN AUER / University of Hong Kong] Its not just about  the EU, its about the european currency right? Theyre  determined to stay in the eurozone and I cannot see how they can  stay in the eurozone if they truly deliver on what they promise  the people. [TAIMUR BAIG / Chief Economist, Asia, Deutsche Bank] I think  that the eventuality of something like this 2 years ago would  have been very disruptive. we;ve had a lot of friewalls built  within the eurozone area and we have a very proactive central  bank now so I think the abilityof the eurozone to take a hit, he  worse case scenario which is a greek -exit, even that is there.  So I think that to some extent, the pricing in of an extreme  event is there.  CNBC Qian Chen, reporting from Singapore.
One-on-One with Jack Welch#Yesterday I spoke to the legendary Jack Welch, former Chairman and CEO of GE. In addition to his comments on a variety of issues, I began asking Mr. Welch about the very sad passing of Steve Jobs.LARRY KUDLOW, host: We welcome back to THE KUDLOW REPORT an old friend, the great famed CEO Jack Welch. Mr. Welch, thank you for coming back, sir. Mr. JACK WELCH: Larry, its great to be here. KUDLOW: Let me just begin, as we have all day, luminaries like yourself, the way too soon passing of the brilliantentrepreneur Steve Jobs, whats your thought on that? Mr. WELCH: Absolutely tragic. I mean, his family has certainly had the biggest loss, but America and the world has lost something. He wasnt just a genius entrepreneur, he was an executor. He got—people are not giving him enough credit for getting a million or two million or five million to the customer on time with great quality. Thats a real job. KUDLOW: He was a great retailer and a great marketer you got there. Mr. WELCH: Great marketer. Great—a supply chain manager and a great genius of an entrepreneur. He—to show you his impact, though, I had an experience at home. My stepsons grandmother called, 85 years old, upset as could be. KUDLOW: Mm-hmm. Mr. WELCH: The kids called from college, two of them. They dont call when CEOs die. KUDLOW: Yeah. Mr. WELCH: They were so impacted. What this guy did for business, he invented cool. KUDLOW: Yeah. Mr. WELCH: He made cool--most business guys are in suits like you are and I am right now. KUDLOW: Right. Mr. WELCH: This guy, though, delivered products that made business cool. KUDLOW: And he made a better world of it. I think... Mr. WELCH: You know... KUDLOW: ...everybody agrees that his impact was just vastly beyond just being a businessman. Mr. WELCH: Oh. KUDLOW: Just vastly beyond. Mr. WELCH: I mean, he was a true visionary. KUDLOW: Yeah. All right, I appreciate that very much. Let me come back to some of the current events of the day. President Obama had a lengthy news conference today, over an hour. Among the many points he made, I want to get your take on this, he is endorsing the Senate Democrats idea of a 5.6 percent surtax on millionaires. And the president also indicated, however, that other tax increases would still be necessary to fund the budget. Do we need a millionaires tax? Will it help the economy grow? And the whole tax plan, how do you see it?
Saudi Arabia withdraws overseas funds#Saudi Arabia has withdrawn tens of billions of dollars from  global asset managers as the oil-rich kingdom seeks to cut its  widening deficit and reduce exposure to volatile equities markets  amid the sustained slump in oil prices.  The Saudi Arabian Monetary Agencys foreign reserves have slumped  by nearly $73 billion since oil prices started to decline last year as  the kingdom keeps spending to sustain the economy and fund its  military campaign in Yemen.  The central bank is also turning to domestic banks to finance a  bond programme to offset the rapid decline in reserves.
Obama response to 2016 Russian election meddling had many flaws,#The Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday issued its long-awaited report on how former President Barack Obama handled Russian meddling in the 2016 election.The bipartisan report found that the Obama administration was ill-prepared to handle the novel election interference offensive and recommended that in the future the public should be informed as soon as possible if a foreign active measures campaign is detected.After discovering the existence, if not the full scope, of Russias election interference efforts in late-2016, the Obama Administration struggled to determine the appropriate response, the committees GOP chairman, Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina, said in a statement.Frozen by paralysis of analysis, hamstrung by constraints both real and perceived, Obama officials debated courses of action without truly taking one, he said.Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the committees top Democrat, said that there were many flaws with the Obama administrations response but noted that many of those were due to problems with our own system – problems that can and should be corrected.The report was released one day after President Donald Trump was acquitted by the Senate of a charge that he abused his power by seeking to pressure the government of Ukraine to open investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden. He was also acquitted of a charge of obstruction of Congress. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.Trump, who spent the first two years of his presidency dogged by a federal investigation into whether he unlawfully conspired with the Russian government in the 2016 election, has criticized Obama for his handling of the situation.He did NOTHING, and had no intention of doing anything! Trump wrote in a post on Twitter last year.The U.S. intelligence community concluded in 2017 that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign during the 2016 campaign targeting Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and that the Russian government had a clear preference for Trump.The attacks included the pilfering of data and emails from Democratic National Committee networks which were then released to outlets including WikiLeaks, an anti-secrecy group, in a manner designed to raise doubts about Clintons viability.The Senate Intelligence Committee also concluded that the Russian government sought to bolster Trumps 2016 election chances.Former special counsel Robert Mueller, who led the investigation into Trumps campaign, concluded that Trump expected to benefit from Russian interference. Mueller, however, did not establish coordination between Trumps associates and the Russian disinformation campaign.Trump tweetThe Senate report released Thursday is the third, out of an expected five, stemming from the committees probe into the governments handling of Russian meddling efforts. The investigation began in 2017 and has proceeded on a largely bipartisan basis, in contrast with parallel congressional inquiries.
Ride Along rumbles to a second win at US box#Ride Along, a buddy cop comedy starring Kevin Hart and Ice  Cube, raced to the top of the weekend box office charts for the  second week in a row, collecting $21.2 million in ticket sales.  The Afghanistan war tale Lone Survivor took the No. 2 spot with  ticket sales of $12.6 million.

Funny Business in Social Networking#Earlier this week I discussed the Dopeler Effect — The tendency of stupid ideas to seem smarter when they come at you rapidly.Im thinking I should rename this blog The Dopeler Effect. Or at least use that title for the occasional post. Like this one. Todays example of the Dopeler Effect involves social networking. Our desire to share every little detail about ourselves can be a really stupid idea that seems smart because everyone else is rapidly doing it all over the internet. Whether its on , or newer Web sites like foursquare, some of us even reveal our exact locations. Burglars must be thrilled. A new Web site is trying to scare us straight. Its called PleaseRobMe.com. The site was reportedly created by three Dutch developers after one of them was awakened at night by a would-be burglar. Afterwards, he started thinking about what might have happened if he hadnt been home. Then he started thinking about all the people who broadcast such news on the internet. Then they created the Web site. PleaseRobMe.com tracks—and posts for public consumption—announcements by people all over the world notifying the online world that theyre not at home. Im at Manhattan Beach Farmers Market says @captainsean. Gee, bet Captain Sean is pleased that PleaseRobMe.com is distributing the news. Except he already did that himself. Our intention is not, and never has been, to have people burgled, the site says. All this site is, is a dressed up Twitter page. Everybody can get this information. Ok, so youre not home and you tweet that. Thats not a problem as long as burglars dont know where you live, right? Make sure it stays that way, because sometimes it doesnt. Even if you never post your home address on social networking sites, others might. It gets even worse if you have friends who want to colonize your house, says the Web site. That means they have to enter your address, to tell everyone where they are. Your address.. on the internet. The Web site advice? Now you know what to do when people reach for their phone as soon as they enter your home. Thats right, slap them across the face. PleaseRobMe has been funded by a company called For The Hack, which describes itself as a launching pad for early stage ideas and concepts. They claim the site has gotten so much buzz theyre now looking to offer it a foundation or agency which can raise awareness about online privacy issues. Ive contacted the owners to see if theyve had any takers yet. Ive also asked if anyone has threatened to sue them for republishing what was already public.Ill let you know. By the way, Im home right now. With my ferocious basset hound, er, Doberman. Questions? Comments? Funny Stories? Email
US Supreme Court rejects appeal over Merrill broker bias#WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court onMonday refused to consider an appeal by Bank of America Corps Merrill Lynch unit of a ruling that allowed blackbrokers who accused it of bias to pursue their lawsuit as aclass action.

Dukes, that made itsignificantly harder to pursue class-action cases.   The lawsuit accused Merrill of steering blacks into clericalpositions and diverting lucrative accounts to white brokers,resulting in lower pay and fewer career growth opportunities.(Reporting By Jonathan Stempel in Washington, D.C.; Editing byMaureen Bavdek)((jon.stempel@thomsonreuters.com)(646)(223-6317)(ReutersMessaging: jon.stempel.reuters.com@thomsonreuters.net))Keywords: USA COURT/BANKOFAMERICA MERRILL
Theres more than one way to invest in solar power#Solar companies, already benefiting from booming share prices,  are turning to increasingly innovative ways to raise capital,  including bond issues, bank loans and even  crowd-funding. SolarCity—Wall Streets newest renewable energy darling—last week announced that it will offer debt  investments backed by pools of solar assets this year. Last year,  SolarCity, which is backed by Tesla Motors founder Elon Musk, issued  about $54.4 million in the first-ever solar bonds. They secured  an investment-grade rating from Standard & Poors.
US dollar weakens as Fed measure weighs#The dollar fell against a basket of major currencies on Tuesday modestly pressured by the weight of Federal Reserve measures meant to ensure there was enough liquidity in the global financial system.The dollar earlier in the session benefited from quarterly and fiscal year-end demand from portfolio managers and Japanese firms, but trading was choppy, with the dollar alternating between gains and losses.For the quarter, the dollar was the biggest gainer, rising 2.8%. The Norwegian crown was the biggest loser, falling 18% against the dollar.Analysts said the steep fall in U.S. equity markets during March led to increased buying of dollars for asset managers seeking to rebalance their portfolios at the end of the month.But the U.S. currency pared gains in the aftermath of the latest Fed move on Tuesday to expand the ability of dozens of foreign central banks to access dollars during the coronavirus crisis. Essentially, the Fed is allowing foreign central banks to exchange their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities for overnight dollar loans.It is one of a slew of measures that the Fed unleashed to address liquidity problems caused by the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.That has dented the dollars luster a bit as the supply of the U.S. currency expands.The dollar will struggle to extend gains significantly at the moment just because of the relative supply of cash coming in from the Fed in dollar terms, said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto.In afternoon trading, the dollar index was down 0.2% on the day at 99.042.It reached 102.99, its highest in more than three years, earlier this month as a global market sell-off fueled a rush for dollars. Dollar demand has ebbed, but analysts are still forecasting more dollar gains. Against the yen, the dollar slipped 0.2% to 107.57 yen. For the quarter, the dollar was down 1.1%.Tuesday was the last trading day of Japans fiscal year and the end of the quarter for major investors elsewhere, which has fueled some volatility as big currency market players close their books. The bulk of those positioning changes caused the dollar to strengthen earlier.The dollar also weakened after data showed U.S. consumer confidence dropped to a near three-year low in March as households worried about the economys near-term outlook amid the coronavirus pandemic.The euro, meanwhile, was down 0.2% against the dollar at $1.1007, falling 1.8% in the first quarter.Some analysts believed that the dollar is likely to remain supported as investors brace for a sharp economic downturn in the coming quarters.The Feds efforts so far are the closest thing to taming the dollars strength, said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington.But the desire to hold dollars remains elevated ahead of whats expected to be a punishing second quarter for U.S. and global growth.
Blackstone, Apax Eye Weather Investments Stake: WSJ#Blackstone Group and Apax Partners Worldwide are front-runners to buy a minority stake in Weather Investments SpA, a telecom holding company controlled by Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris, the Wall Street Journal reports. The purchase price could total 1.2 billion euros (US$1.7 billion), the Journal said, citing people close to the talks. Other possible buyers include TPG Capital, the sources said. Sawiris in an interview told the paper he had planned to take his company public, but now was more inclined to sell a 10% to 12% stake. A sale, which could value Weather at more than 10 billion euros, could happen as early as the next few weeks, he said. Proceeds could be used to pay down debt or for new acquisitions, he said in the Journal interview. One business in his sights is Frances Bouygues Telecom, part of the Bouygues group, the paper said. Weather owns Italys Wind Telecomunicazioni, Greek wireless operator Wind Hellas Telecommunications, and a 51% stake in Orascom Telecom Holding, the Middle East and Africas largest telecom company by customers.

Fed likely to reassure markets that it is watchful of#The Fed is not expected to take any action on its benchmark fed funds rate this week, but it is likely to reassure markets that it is watching the outbreak of the coronavirus and other geopolitical uncertainties.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is slated to brief the press after the Fed releases its statement Wednesday afternoon, and it is in those comments investors will likely get the most insight into the Feds thinking. The Fed starts its two-day meeting Tuesday.They might say something about paying attention to global developments, but I wouldnt expect them to do anything at this point, said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. Strategists expect the Fed has been watching tensions in the Middle East and now the coronavirus.Theyre looking at the global economy and it doesnt look like it will have much affect at the moment, he said. It is still unclear how serious the virus will become, or how it will impact the Chinese and other economies. By Monday, the virus had affected 2,900 people and killed 82.On the policy side, the Fed is expected to hold rates steady and not signal any other moves.I think the Fed will be silent, said Joseph Quinlan, head of CIO market strategy at Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank. Theyve come into 2020 with their work done. This is a political year. Theyve done their job when it comes to cutting rates. I think theyre in wait-and-see mode.The biggest issue for markets is when the Fed will slow and ultimately stop its purchases of Treasury bills, an effort credited by some for a surge in liquidity that has helped boost risk assets, particularly stocks, and tighten credit spreads. The Fed began purchasing $60 billion a month to expand its balance sheet and increases reserves, after problems in the short-term funding market created a temporary snap up in overnight rates.The Fed has calmed the short-term lending market with the purchases and also ongoing repurchase, or repo, operations. It has said it would continue its operations to help the repo market through the tax season, when there could be higher-than-normal demand for short-term cash. The repo market is basically the plumbing for the financial markets and is where financial institutions go for short term cash.It would be nice if they did discuss it, but I dont know if theyre going to or not, said John Briggs, head of strategy at NatWest Markets. Briggs said he doesnt expect Powell to reveal much in the way of specifics on how it will wind down its Treasury bill purchases. He expects the Fed to say in March that it is paring back those purchases from $60 billion to $40 billion, and then will taper them down.BlackRocks Rick Rieder said he will be listening for how the Fed describes inflation since it has said it is willing to let it run hotter than its 2% target, though the measure it watches has not yet met the target. He, too, is looking for clarification on the Feds plans for its T-bill buying program.He expects the Fed to discuss it by mid-second quarter. I think theyll start to taper it down, and I think theyll be very deliberate and prescriptive about how theyre going to do that, said Rieder, BlackRocks global CIO of fixed income.He said the Fed is adding a lot of liquidity to the financial system on its own, but it is even more massive when combined with the efforts of the Peoples Bank of China and the European Central Bank.I think theyll start to taper down the program some time during or toward the middle or the end of the second quarter, he said. My sense is theyre beginning the discussions but those discussions will gather momentum in the next month or two.Rieder said he expects more Fed officials to become concerned about their policy causing too easy financial conditions, boosting stocks and tightening credit spreads. My sense is thats going to be very slow in incubating that idea.The one thing Ive got my eye on is I think at some point in the next couple of months, assuming what is happening now is a relatively near term risk, I think a lot of the discussion is going to head toward financial conditions, Rieder said. Youve had some of the Fed members talking about financial conditions.The Fed is also expected to boost the interest rate on excess reserves by five basis points. Thats a technical tool that it would hope would push its fed funds rate slightly higher. The fed funds rate has been at 1.55%, the low end of its 1.50 to 1.75% range.Historically, the Fed has made these adjustments when the funds rate has been trading within 5 basis points of the borders of the target range, as it has recently, notes JPMorgan chief U.S. economist Michael Feroli. The markets and the public seem to have understood that these technical adjustments do not represent a change in the stance of monetary policy and we expect that to continue to be the case next week.
Wednesday Look Ahead: Watch the Financials, Euro#The financial sector will be at the crux of market worries Wednesday, as the U.S. Senate moves closer to a vote on banking reform and German regulators explain their surprise move to ban naked short-selling on a group of bank stocks and sovereign debt.Investors are looking for clarity on Germanys late day move Tuesday to ban naked short selling in the shares of 10 German financial institutions and in euro zone sovereign debt. The ban, which took effect at midnight, would also apply to credit default swaps based on those bonds. German officials hold a press briefing on the ban Wednesday.As news of the rules slipped out during the early afternoon in New York, the euro went into a dive, taking risk assets, like stocks and oil with it. The euro  fell to a fresh four-year low against the dollar, touching $1.2161 before finishing at $1.2213. Oil fell nearly 1 percent to $69.41, its lowest close since last September.The Dow finished down 114 points at 10,510, after being up as much as 93 points on the day. The S&P 500 fell 15 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1120.Euro TrashedThe measures today were missing the forest for the trees, said David Gilmore of Foreign Exchange Analytics. Really all they do is channel more of the market risk takers into expressing their negative view on the euro zone into the currency.
Greek journalist tried over Swiss bank list#* List named Greeks with Swiss bank accounts* Journalist faces up to two years in jail if convicted* Greeks angry over govts tax evasion* Speed of arrest, trial criticisedATHENS, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Greek lawyers launched their defence of a prominent journalist on Thursday charged with breaking private data rules after he published the names of more than 2,000 wealthy Greeks believed to be holding Swiss bank accounts.The printing of the ``Lagarde List by magazine editor Costas Vaxavanis has touched a nerve in almost-bankrupt Greece, where rampant tax evasion is undermining a struggle to cut public costs and raise revenue under an EU/IMF bailout deal.His speedy arrest and trial following publication at the weekend has enraged many here already furious over consecutive governments failure to crack down on a rich elite, who they blame for years of recession that has wiped out a fifth of economic output and hammered middle-class living standards.Vaxevanis, editor of the ``Hot Doc weekly, was surrounded by fellow journalists and other supporters who packed the Athens courtroom as his lawyers began their defence.They argued the prosecution had charged him without any of those on the list having filed a complaint about privacy violation, a rare occurance in a freedom of speech or defamation case in Greece.``Hes been accused without reason, said Nicos Constantopoulous, his lawyer and a former leftist politician. ``The principles of a fair trial are not being followed.Under Greek laws covering sensitive data, a defendant must stand trial within 48 hours if arrested within a day of charges being filed in absentia. Vaxevanis faces up to two years in prison if convicted.He has said he received the list, named after International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde who gave it to authorities in several EU countries in 2010 when she was French finance minister, from an anonymous source.Another newspaper, daily Ta Nea, also published the 2,059 names, which includes several politicians as well as many businessmen, shippnig magnates, doctors, lawyers and housewives, over 10 pages.It said the accounts had held about 2 billion euros until 2007 but also made clear that there was no evidence any of them had broken tax evasion laws.
GoodRx co-CEO says Amazon Pharmacy is complementary, not a competitor#Shares of GoodRx, a company that finds users prescription drugs at a discount, plunged this week after Amazon announced online prescription fulfillment. But GoodRx co-CEO Doug Hirsch said investors fear was misguided, that the two companies are complementary, not competitors.The headlines say its GoodRx versus Amazon, I say no. GoodRx is a marketplace, Amazon is a pharmacy, Hirsch said at CNBCs Disruptor 50 Summit on Wednesday. People perceive it as going head-to-head with us, but its not.GoodRx, founded in 2011 by Facebook veteran Hirsch and software entrepreneur Trevor Bezdek, offers users a free list of discount cards and coupons to cut down costs of their prescription medication.Amazon Pharmacy, meanwhile, will allow customers in the United States to order prescription medications for home delivery. The company will also give Amazon Prime members additional perks, such as free delivery and potential discounts.I think theyre trying to do what they do best, which is mail order, Hirsch said. I dont see it as competitive, I see it as complementary.However, Wall Street hasnt been swayed. The companys stock dropped more than 6% Wednesday after JPMorgan downgraded the platform to underweight from neutral, citing the launch of Amazon Pharmacy as a threat.GoodRx ranked No. 20 on this years CNBC Disruptor 50 list.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.

How to rethink your retirement income strategy as more firms#The coronavirus-induced economic upheaval is taking a toll on a popular source of investment income for retirees: dividends.As U.S. companies deal with steep revenue drops and are forced to cut expenses, 203 stocks this year have reduced or suspended their dividends, 44 of them on the S&P 500 index. And, with economic uncertainty remaining going forward, that number could grow.I definitely expect this to continue, unfortunately, said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst with S&P Dow Jones Indices, which keeps tabs on dividend actions by publicly traded common stock with a market capitalization of $25 million or more.

Banks in Europe struggle to find talent with US rivals#European banks are finding it hard to recruit the right people due to new regulations and intense competition from some of their U.S. peers, industry insiders have told CNBC.It is a vicious circle, isnt it? a senior executive at a European bank told CNBC who preferred to remain anonymous due to the sensitive nature of the topic.You want to hire the right talent because you can see the business is suffering, but you dont get approvals for the headcount and when you finally do, you arent able to match the salaries, they told CNBC.Pay in the banking sector is generally higher compared to other industries. A junior-level analyst in a trading role at a European bank can start at anything between $50,000 to $60,000 for a base salary. On top of this they would receive allowances and a bonus, which can sometimes be given in the form of company shares.This is where U.S. banks differ as they tend to stick to cash bonuses, taking the overall compensation of a junior analyst to somewhere between $80,000 to $100,000. This gap starts to widen more as employees go up the ladder.

Amazon announces three new renewable energy projects, including its first#Amazon announced three renewable energy projects on Thursday, saying it was committed to minimizing carbon emissions following criticism earlier this year.The tech giant said the facilities would provide energy to its Amazon Web Services data centers. A wind farm, with a max capacity of 50 megawatts (MW), will be situated on Scotlands Kintyre Peninsula and is expected to produce 168,000 megawatt hours (MWh) of energy each year. Amazon said the facility could power the equivalent of 46,000 U.K. homes and would be the U.K.s largest corporate wind power purchase agreement. Additionally, two solar projects in North Carolina and Virginia will amount to 215 MW of total capacity, with Amazon expecting them to produce 500,997 MWh per year. The projects announced Thursday are expected to start generating energy in 2021. They are not owned by the company, but it says its commitment to purchase their output enables the projects to be built. In a statement issued Thursday, Amazons Director of Sustainability Kara Hurst said the firm was committed to minimizing our carbon emissions and reaching 80% renewable energy use across the company by 2024.In June, Amazon was one of more than 700 firms targeted by 88 investors for not reporting environmental information. The aim of the investors was to push businesses such as Amazon to disclose information via the CDP, a not-for-profit platform which enables companies to divulge environmental performance data.A few months earlier, in April, thousands of Amazon employees signed an open letter to CEO Jeff Bezos and the firms board of directors, imploring them to take action on climate change.In September, Amazon co-founded an initiative called The Climate Pledge, which asks signatories to become net zero carbon across their businesses by the year 2040.It has also launched what it calls a transparency website which it uses to report on what it describes as its sustainability commitments, initiatives, and performance. The site also has information on the firms carbon footprint, which it reports as being 44.40 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent for the 2018 fiscal year.Amazon is just one of many global technology firms looking to power operations using renewable sources of energy. In March 2019, for example, Microsoft signed a 15-year power purchase agreement for the energy produced by a 74-megawatt solar power facility in North Carolina, while in April 2018 Apple announced its global facilities were powered using 100 percent clean energy.Making sure that its facilities are powered by clean energy is a multi-faceted process for Apple.In its Environmental Responsibility Report covering the 2018 fiscal year the California-headquartered firm said that, where feasible, it sourced renewable energy by building its own projects. In addition, it invests capital to become a part owner in wind and solar projects and signs long-term renewable energy contracts.
Ready or not, New York commuters to get taste of#With two months of urgent repairs beginning at New Yorks Pennsylvania Station, commuters on Monday may get their first taste of the havoc the track work is expected to bring to the challenge of getting into and out of the largest U.S. city.New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has predicted a summer of hell for commuters as scheduled repairs force a partial shutdown of the busiest passenger train hub in the country from July 10 through Sept. 1, or longer if work falls behind schedule.Track closures mean some people find other ways into the city, including ferries, buses and PATH trains, a subway line running between lower Manhattan and New Jersey.One harried New Jersey commuter suggested that finding a way to work every day was a task best suited for members of a club for geniuses.
UPDATE 1-EADS, BAE in last-ditch struggle to save merger#(Adds defence analyst comment, share movement)   * Doubts over German backing for $45 bln aerospace merger   * UK Takeover Panel deadline at 1600 GMT   * BAE shares down 1.6 pct   By Sophie Sassard and Jason Neely   LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - EADS  and BAE Systems are engaged in a final push to rescue their $45 billionaerospace merger from the political jockeying that threatens tosink it, as doubts grow over German backing for the deal.   The European companies have until 1600 GMT on Wednesday todeclare their intentions and either scrap their merger or ask UKregulators for more time or finalise their plans to create theworlds largest aerospace and arms group.   We will keep going until 5 (pm London time), a personinvolved in the negotiations said.   Several sources close to the negotiations said GermanChancellor Angela Merkel had opposed the proposal to combineAirbus passenger airplanes with UK defence contractor BAE.   Merkel is against the deal but has not given reasons, asource involved in the negotiations said.   A spokesman for the German government declined to comment.   Early on Wednesday EADS said it had no plans to issue astatement in the morning.   At 0925 GMT shares in BAE were down 1.6 percent at 320.2pence in London, while EADS shares were down 0.15 percent at26.065 euros in Paris.   Brinkmanship is common in European negotiations, andFranco-German-led EADS was itself only created after talks aboutits structure collapsed and were resurrected weeks later.   But with the current negotiations taking place in a glare ofpublicity, the margin for manoeuvre is rapidly dwindling.   On Tuesday, French Defence Minister Jean-Yves le Drian saidnegotiations on the merger had moved forward.  We had made a lot of progress, I think, but have weprogressed enough? That is up to those who initiated the projectto say, the minister said.   But by late that evening it appeared that there were threelines drawn in the sand, each of which excluded one of theBritish, French and German governments, leaving the highlypolitical European merger in danger of collapse.<^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Graphic on EADS/BAE market cap and share prices: Factbox on the two companies:^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>   THREE-WAY TUSSLE   France and Germany want to keep a strong say in the combinedcompany, while Britain wants to protect BAE from stateownership, which could affect its contracts in the UnitedStates.   Germany and Britain could accept lower state shareholdingsthan is the case at EADS, which is more than half controlled byFrance, Germany and Spain, but France rejects that.   France and Britain, meanwhile, could accept unequal stakesbetween France and Germany, but Berlin demands parity. Sourcesinvolved in the deal said Germany also wanted to ensure therewas a major headquarters in Munich to counter corporate centresin Toulouse, France, and Farnborough, Britain.   Under rules set by the UK Takeover Panel, EADS and BAE canask for an extension to their negotiations, but only if EADShas every reason to believe that it can and will continue to beable to implement the offer.   Extending the deadline will not change the dynamics of thenegotiation and would almost certainly weaken the positions ofKing and Enders going forward, as it would signal they felt theyhad no other acceptable options, said David Reeths, Directorfor consulting at defence analysts IHS Janes.   Negotiators described the atmosphere as tense and frustratedas bickering immediately broke out behind the scenes to lay theblame elsewhere in case the talks officially break down.   The merger has faced growing unease from investors in bothcompanies who complained they were ill-prepared and lackinginformation. Many people bought shares in EADS on the strengthof its Airbus civil unit, rather than its defence ambitions,while BAE investors were attracted by its dividend yield.(Additional reporting by Matthias Blamont, Arno Schuetze, PaulTaylor, Andrea Shalal-Esa and Tim Hepher; Writing by Tim Hepherand Jane Barrett; Editing by Will Waterman)((tim.hepher@thomsonreuters.com)(+33 1 49 49 54 52)(ReutersMessaging: tim.hepher.thomsonreuters@reuters.net))Keywords: EADS BAE/

Congress, White House: Up For Late Summer Fight?#Summer isnt over yet, but the languid pace that has prevailed in Washington since Congress left town in August has now definitively vanished. On every front, the White House and Congress, Republicans and Democrats, are girding for political action that will unfold rapidly with its ultimate consequences uncertain.Lets look at the most important points of engagement: --The elephant in the room: the Iraq war. This is President Bushs top priority and theres no close second. Facing resistance from Congressional Democrats, Bush sought a momentum boost with his surprise visit to Iraq in advance of Gen. David Petraeus testimony on the troop surge in Washington next week. Bush and even some Democrats see signs of military progress; Democratic leaders said the US military commitment isnt leading to political reconciliation that would allow troops to come home. --The new wild card: the economy. When you have a single issue stirring fear and anxiety among hedge fund markets, pension fund investors, and moderate-income homeowners, theres potential for a powerful political reaction. Thats what the mortgage mess has produced. Bush responded last week with his limited assistance proposals, while Democrats want more -- including potential cash bailouts. This may be one area where Democratic and Republican choose to work together. --The old battle: taxes and spending. Republicans bruised by the unpopularity of Iraq and scandal drama (see: Craig, Larry) are spoiling to battle Democrats over one of their familiar themes. Thats what Bush is threatening to veto spending bills from the Democratic Congress, and almost certainly would do the same if Democrats could muster the votes to raise taxes on private equity. The GOP badly needs to reclaim the tax-spending brand. --The backdrop: the 2008 elections. The campaign trail has almost supplanted Washington as the focus of national attention already. And that trend will only increase. A Wednesday night debate in New Hampshire will showcase the tightrope Republican candidates have to walk between distancing themselves from an unpopular White House and building support among the Republican base. The next morning, the new Republican candidate, Fred Thompson will enter the race in Iowa (having appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on the same night of that GOP debate).
Countries With the Most Expensive Private Schools#Despite the rising cost of private schools, demand continues to grow across the world. For many, private schooling buys luxury, exclusivity and privacy. In many developing countries, private education is a must-have for parents who want their children to succeed.Across the world, the cost of private education has risen faster than incomes. In the U.S., private high schools cost over $40,000, compared to a median income of around $50,000.  In the U.K., boarding school fees jumped 65 percent from 1992 to 2008, while household incomes increased only 30 percent over the same period, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.We’ve put together a list of the countries with the most expensive private schools based on the cost of sending a child to one of the top three or four private schools in that country.We used annual tuition fees for high school students for both day and boarding schools. Since boarding is often the more expensive option, we ranked the countries by boarding fees, except in the cases of China and Brazil.The fees we considered include boarding, food and basic curriculum costs, but exclude charges such as registration fees, deposits, extra-curricular activities and field trips. We also excluded schools that specialized in children with special needs.Click ahead to find out which countries have the world’s most expensive private schools.By  Posted: June 19, 2011
Stripe raises new capital, reaching $95 billion valuation ahead of#Online payments technology provider Stripe announced Sunday that it has raised a new $600 million round of funding that values the company at $95 billion — nearly triple its last reported valuation of $36 billion from April 2020, according to PitchBook data.Stripe, which makes software that allows businesses to accept payments over the internet, intends to invest the new capital into its European operations, the company said in a release. Thirty-one of the 42 countries that Stripe operates in are located in Europe, and President and Co-Founder John Collison singled out Ireland — where the company is headquartered — as a particular area of focus.Founded more than a decade ago, today Stripe is by far the most valuable private fintech company, with Robinhood trailing at a roughly $11.7 billion valuation after investors wrote the company a $3 billion check amid this years GameStop chaos.Stripe has seen eye-popping growth during the pandemic as its revenue is largely tied to growth in online shopping. In its previous funding round last April, Stripe was early to highlight the Covid-19 outbreak as pushing the economy online and said several years of offline-to-online migration are being compressed into several weeks.Were investing in the infrastructure that will power internet commerce in 2030 and beyond, wrote chief financial officer Dhivya Suryadevara, who joined the company in August after moving out of her role as General Motors CFO. The pandemic taught us many things about society, including how much can be achieved — and paid for — online, but the internet still isnt the engine for global economic progress that it could be.In December, the company launched banking services through partnerships with Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Barclays and Evolve Bank & Trust.

US credit access, financial fragility improve: Fed survey#Americans access to credit improved while their perceived vulnerability to a financial shock declined, according to a Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey that painted a slightly more optimistic picture of U.S. households.The so-called survey of consumer expectations found that respondents who were too discouraged to apply for credit over the past 12 months declined to 4.9 percent in October, continuing a downward trend and reaching its lowest level since the survey began in 2013.The survey, done every four months, also found a rise in those applying for and accessing credit, and a drop in rejections. It focuses on mortgages and refinancing, credit cards and limit increases, and auto loans.The New York Fed also updated its gauge of so-called financial fragility, which measures expectations.While the average probability of respondents needing $2,000 for an unexpected expense in the next month rose to 33 percent, from 32 percent previously, the probability of being able to come up with the funds also rose to nearly 70 percent, from 67 percent.

Wealth Gap Rises Between Whites, Non-Whites#People like to talk about “the wealth gap” as relating only to the one percent and the 99. But there are actually multiple wealth gaps emerging – by age, gender and now, by race.According to a study by the Census Bureau, the wealth gap between whites, Hispanics and black Americans grew during the recession.Between 2005 and 2010, the media net worth of white Americans (non-Hispanic) fell 15 percent, to $110,729. The median net worth of black Americans fell 55 percent to $4,955. And the median net worth of Hispanic Americans fell 56 percent, to $7,424. The net worth of Asians fell 54 percent, to $69,590.
U.S. Treasurys Higher in Reversal of Sell-Off#U.S. Treasurys prices were modestly higher in extremely quiet trading, in a partial reversal of Fridays sell-off.With very little economic data to speak of, activity is somewhat subdued and liquidity is definitely impaired, said Jason Evans, head of government trading for Deutsche Bank.The price of the Treasurys 10-year note was up around midday, while its yield fell from Fridays level, when trading desks closed early ahead of the Christmas holiday. Prices and yields move in opposite directions.A manufacturing and economic activity report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond released Tuesday morning came in at negative 6 versus Novembers 7. However, the data failed to move the market in any noticeable way.The real surprise in the market was Fridays sell-off, Evans said. Fridays data _ and in particular the core personal consumption expenditures price index, a key measure of inflation _ were on the tamer side. Compared with a year earlier, the core PCE price index rose 2.2% in November from a year earlier, down from a 2.4% year-over-year climb in October.However, despite what should have been bond-friendly data, the Treasurys market sold off heavily, largely on profit-taking.The sell-off Friday occurred on relatively light volume, Evans said, and the market is ... in recovery.Hedge funds were in the market buying 10-year Treasurys Tuesday, with good buying by money managers in five-year Treasurys as well, according to RBS Greenwich Capital.As for the remainder of the week, we are rather neutral, RBS Greenwich noted in market commentary.

Poll: Which is your favorite major tech stock reporting earnings#Some of the biggest technology names on Wall Street are set to announce earnings this week that could potentially bring the tech sectors rally to a crashing halt. Of the four so-called FANG stocks, three are reporting this week: Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon.

China passes controversial counter-terrorism law#Chinas parliament passed a controversial new anti-terrorism law  on Sunday that requires technology firms to hand over sensitive  information such as encryption keys to the government and allows  the military to venture overseas on counter-terror operations.  Chinese officials say their country faces a growing threat from  militants and separatists, especially in its unruly Western  region of Xinjiang, where hundreds have died in violence in the  past few years.  The law has attracted deep concern in Western capitals, not only  because of worries it could violate human rights such as freedom  of speech, but because of the cyber provisions. U.S. President  Barack Obama has said that he had raised concerns about the law  directly with Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Central banks have almost eliminated recessions, venture capitalist Palihapitiya says#Central banks have created an environment where both major downturns as well as expansions are almost impossible, venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya said Tuesday.A well-known investor across a multitude of areas, including as a very early Facebook executive and a big proponent of cryptocurrencies, Palihapitiya told CNBC that entities like the Federal Reserve have used quantitative easing to stage-manage an essentially stagnant economy.I dont see a world in which we have any form of meaningful contraction nor any form of meaningful expansion, he told CNBCs Scott Wapner during a Fast Money Halftime Report segment. We have completely taken away the toolkit of how normal economies should work when we started with QE. I mean, the odds that theres a recession anymore in any Western country of the world is almost next to impossible now, save a complete financial externality that we cant forecast.A lack of downturns is not necessarily a good thing, Palihapitiya added, and he criticized central banks for refusing to allow normal economic cycles to play out.Central bankers have lost all intestinal fortitude to actually put a country through a recession, because its actually regenerative and useful, he said. Even if they had the wherewithal to do it, the political infrastructure will just completely absorb that intent. So we are probably not, save of something crazy, going to see massive, massive negative growth except in countries that are so fundamentally crippled that they tip over.For investors, that means a limited menu of choices.So the reality is were going to grow low single digits every year, which means theres no growth anywhere else, which means youre better off buying equities and youre better off buying equities that are substantively ones that are sort of the deflationary stocks, the cheaper, faster better stocks, the tech stocks, he said.Palihapitiya is CEO of Social Capital and he also is a minority stakeholder and board member of the NBAs Golden State Warriors.
Stocks Edge Up, Shaking Off Economic News#Stocks edged higher in another choppy, thin-volume session Wednesday after investors largely shrugged off news that ISM non-manufacturing index slipped last month and Chinas latest interest rate increase.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose into positive territory, after snapping a five-day rally in the previous session.  Among the blue-chip index, Bank of America  and JPMorgan  slipped, while DuPont  gained. The S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq also turned higher. The CBOE Volatility Index, widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, gained above 16. Among key S&P stocks, energy and financials slipped, while consumer staples gained. “There’s going to be continued volatility in the markets throughout the summer months into early fall,” said Zahid Siddique, portfolio manager of Gabelli Equity Trust. “[But] as the economic indicators begin to improve, there will be less volatility and more stability in the markets by year-end.” Meanwhile, the ISM non-manufacturing index slipped slightly below estimates to 53.3 in June. Economists expected the index to fall to 54.0.“The market really wanted some glimmer of hope that we’re exiting a soft patch…and this is not it,” Jim Iuorio, director of TJM Institutional Services told CNBC. “There’s too much to bear for the stock market to go higher.”Meanwhile, the number of planned layoffs increasedfor the second month in a row, according a report from job outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. This comes ahead of a number of key employment news starting with ADPs jobs survey and weekly jobless claims on Thursday and the governments monthly report on Friday. The Chinese central bank approved an increase of 0.25 percentage points, the nations latest move to cool growth.The euro slid for a second session against the dollar.
Chilling Saudi-US relations not expected to heat up oil market#Signs of friction between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia have caught  the attention of the oil market, but traders arent concerned  about supply issues for now.  Saudi Arabia has been unhappy about the U.S. approach to Syria  and Iran, and it is apparently making that clear in diplomatic  circles. Last week, it turned down a two-year term on  the U.N. Security Council in protest against inaction over Syria, even  though that body oversees the United Nations handling  of Syria.

Cramer taste-tests the restaurant industry with these two popular chains#Restaurant stocks are the talk of the Street in light of Panera Breads takeover by JAB Holdings, so Jim Cramer turned to two food chains to illustrate the winners and losers of the casual dining market.Both Darden Restaurants, the parent of Olive Garden, and Brinker International, the Chilis parent, rallied almost hand-in-hand in the second half of 2016. Once 2017 hit, however, their stocks went separate ways, with Darden rising almost 15 percent and Brinker sliding 14 percent year-to-date.On the surface, the two companies would seem to have a lot in common, the Mad Money host acknowledged.They are comparable in scale: Brinker has 1,600 restaurants around the globe while Darden has 1,500, and both own smaller brands alongside their trademark restaurants.Watch the full segment here:
NBA finalizes plans to resume season at Disney World in#The National Basketball Association and its players union have finalized plans to resume its 2019-20 season that was halted by Covid-19.The NBA will commence on July 30 at Walt Disney World in Orlando and include 22 teams. Games will be played at the Arena, the Field House and Visa Athletic Center at ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex for the remainder of the season, the league said, adding no spectators will be allowed.We have worked together with the Players Association to establish a restart plan that prioritizes health and safety, preserves competitive fairness and provides a platform to address social justice issues, said NBA Commissioner Adam Silver in a press release. We are grateful to our longtime collaborator Disney for its role in playing host and making this return to play possible, and we also thank the public health officials and infectious disease specialists who helped guide the creation of comprehensive medical protocols and protections.  All 22 teams will compete in eight seeding games to determine the final 16 spots. The games will be selected from clubs remaining regular-season matchups. After the 16 teams are set, the NBAs postseason will transition to its traditional format with four rounds of best-of-seven series. The NBA Finals will end no later than Oct. 13, according to the league. It is very exciting to officially announce the restart of the 2019-2020 season, said Michele Roberts, the National Basketball Players Association executive director. It has taken true collaboration between the league and the union – special kudos to our executive committee and several other team reps – along with the continued support and assistance from medical experts, public health officials and many others.Though the NBA and its players have their plans finalized, concerns remain about sports resuming in Florida as coronavirus cases surge there. Gov. Ron DeSantis said Thursday that the state has no plans at the moment to move forward with its reopening plan. Disney workers from Florida have petitioned the company and local government officials to reconsider the reopening of Disney World next month.Milwaukee Bucks and Avenue Capital co-founder Marc Lasry said on CNBCs Halftime Report  he remains hopeful that the NBA will conclude its season despite Covid-19.Well see what happens over the course of the next two weeks, Lasry said Thursday. He added that for players that dont want to go, I fully respect that but also said, every single one of our guys (Bucks players) is going to be down there.Earlier Friday, the NBA announced 16 of the expected 302 players that will compete in Orlando tested positive for Covid-19. Any player who tested positive will remain in self-isolation until he satisfies public health protocols for discontinuing isolation and has been cleared by a physician, the NBA said in a press release. The NBA will release Friday evening the broadcast schedule for its restart. On March 11, the league became the first U.S. big league organization to suspend its season due to Covid-19.
Loeb reacts to Sothebys poison pill, wants CEO fired#After writing a letter Friday to Sothebys, chiding it for enacting a poison pill, hedge-fund titan  Dan Loeb spoke exclusively to CNBC and said he  expects action.  Loeb wants the company to replace CEO William Ruprecht and add  new board members, including himself. He told CNBC theres no good reason he shouldnt be added to the board, given that hes the largest shareholder and has a track record of  creating value for shareholders.It would be a  shame if we had to wait until proxy season to do  anything, he added.Its incumbent on the board to either say its  satisfied with the CEOs performance or set out a road map as to  how theyre going to improve performance, improve cost issues and  its deteriorating competitive position, Loeb said.  He also commented on the high-flying art market, saying, Its  just getting started and prices will go up from here.

Hedge Funds Face Pressure To Reform#Hedge funds are heading into a rough few weeks. Many funds are looking at some pretty average returns this year--and if thats not bad enough--the industry faces U.S. Congressional hearings starting tomorrow on regulations and insider trading.William Galvin is Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Tom Curran is a securities lawyer and partner with Ganfer and Shore. Both men appeared on Street Signs and have different opinions on what needs--or doesnt need--to be done with hedge funds.Galvin says hedge funds are marketed to people who shouldnt be investing in them. And he says there should be minimum investments and the funds should be registered. He said there needs to be total transparency when it comes to hedge funds.Curran is completely on the other side--saying there is no need for minimum investments. He said Congress should proceed cautiously on hedge funds--considering the role they play in the U.S. economy. He said there are a lot of myths when it comes to hedge funds--and that the criticism is over blown. FYI: There are some 9,228 hedge funds with nearly $1.3 trillion dollars invested in them.
Market Tips: Dollar Outlook is Grim#In the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the U.S. dollar saw widespread declines as the Federal Reserve was forced to slash interest rates to eventually zero. Since then there has been growing speculation that the greenback may not hold on to its status as the world’s reserve currency and faces more declines.  Near-Term Outlook Remains Grim“Near-term it does look pretty tough for the dollar … rates being so low in the US in response to the crisis, that really hurts the dollar, which is used to having a least some yield premium over the Japanese yen for instance,” Sean Callow, senior currency strategist at Westpac Bank, told CNBC. “A pretty grim picture until we get a lot better news on the economy and at this stage it doesn’t seem time yet,” Callow added. Will There Be a Dollar Crisis?“Over the long term you expect the US dollar will remain relatively weak,” Jim Vrondas, manager of corporate business at OzForex, told CNBC. “It’s going to take a long time to unwind these massive deficits that they’ve got going on at the moment and in that kind of environment it’s only naturally that people become a little bit hesitant of holding dollar reserves,” he said. Recovery Still A Few Years AwayJohn Licata, chief investment strategist at Blue Phoenix, says that while the progress over the last 12 months had not been as dramatic as expected, the financial crisis has increased investor awareness. Greed Has ReturnedThe lessons of the past year have been forgotten and risk appetite has returned dramatically on Wall Street, says Richard Bove, financial strategist at Rochdale Securities.US has Not Learned from CrisisThe U.S. has not learnt anything and without dealing with the economys core structural problems, the malaise will continue, says Damon Vickers, CIO at Nine Points Capital Partners. Credit Crisis is Receding: AnalystThe credit crisis is receding, notes Sean Fenton, portfolio manager at Tribeca Investment Partners. He offers his take on how markets will fare going forward.
German consumer morale hits highest level in 6 years#German consumer confidence rose to its highest level in six years  heading into October, supporting expectations strong consumer  spending will help Europes largest economy to post moderate  growth in 2013.  GfK market research group said on Wednesday its forward-looking  consumer sentiment indicator, based on a survey of around 2,000  people, rose to 7.1 going into October from an upwardly revised  7.0 the previous month.  The original September figure was 6.9 and analysts in a Reuters  poll had forecast the October reading at 7.0. The strengthening  data chimed with other recent releases suggesting gradual but  steady growth for the end of the year.  German consumers are expecting the economy to gain momentum in  the next few months, GfK said in a statement. There is a clear  upwards trend.  (Read more: Germans  give Merkel a mandate but markets muted)  Germans, traditionally savers, became more willing to spend in  September than at any point since December 2006, encouraged by an  essentially stable job market and historically low interest  rates. Saving appeared less attractive as inflation overtook bank  interest rates.  A sub-index tracking consumers income expectations eased, albeit  from a high level, due to rising food prices, which dampened  perceived purchasing power.  Its also possible that some consumers fear further financial  burdens due to the euro crisis or tax hikes, the GfK said,  referring to the outcome of the German election which was still  uncertain at the time of the survey.  Angela Merkels conservatives romped to victory in Sundays  election, winning 42 percent of the vote, but are in need of a  coalition partner after falling just short of a parliamentary  majority.  (Read more: The  secret recipe of German economic success)  The chancellor appeared headed towards coalition talks with her  main center-left rivals the Social Democrats (SPD), who had  campaigned on a platform of tax increases for Germanys highest  earners.  Concern over income was offset by strong willingness to buy,  which the GfK dubbed euphoric.  The GfK reiterated its forecast for private consumption to grow  by around 1 percent in real terms in 2013, a sign that the German  economy is on track to grow moderately this year.  The Berlin-based economic think tank DIW forecasts that the  economy will expand by 0.4 percent in 2013, and 1.7 percent in  2014.  (Read more: Euro zone seen growing at  last: Thank Germany)  A bastion of strength in the early stages of the euro zone  crisis, the German economy shrank at the end of last year and  narrowly avoided recession early in 2013 before bouncing back.  Recent data from Germany has been mixed, with the private sector  expanding, unemployment falling and business sentiment  brightening, though industrial data has been weak and exports  have dropped.  Consumers view of the economy in September improved  significantly from the previous month to hit 10.7 points, its  highest level since May 2012.  Separately, according to the Ifo Institute business morale  improved slightly to its highest level in 17 months in September

Kraft is taking the CFTC to court keep the lid#Kraft and Mondelez are taking the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to court in a bid to keep the agency from discussing a $16 million fine to settle allegations of manipulating the wheat markets.The two food companies agreed to pay the fine as part of a deal with the CFTC that the companies say restricted what regulators could say about the case. Kraft and Mondelez, which was created when Kraft split into two companies in 2012, are now suing the CFTC for contempt. They filed a motion in federal court in Chicago on Friday, saying the regulator violated the order in an Aug. 15 press release announcing the deal.The CFTC and its Commissioners engaged in a deliberate, orchestrated effort to violate the Courts Consent Order within minutes of its entry, the companies said in the filing. The two sides face off in court Sept. 12, according to court documents.According to the CFTC, Kraft intentionally drove down the price of wheat in 2011 by buying an excessive amount of futures contracts on the grain.Food companies have made such moves to hedge fluctuations in commodities prices by agreeing to pay a specific price at a specific date in the future. Unlike a hedge fund or trading firm, companies like Kraft are limited in their futures purchases and are prohibited from speculating.Kraft was allowed to have a futures position of roughly 3 million bushels of wheat, the CFTC said in the original complaint. Instead, Kraft allegedly bought futures contracts for 15.75 million bushels, worth more than $93 million.The consent order included a clause that read neither party shall make any public statement about this case other than to refer to the terms of this settlement agreement or public documents filed in this case.The order also prohibited the CFTC from saying whether either defendant violated federal law.After the agreement, the CFTC issued a press release on Aug. 15 saying the penalty was valued at three times the alleged gain and included statements from Chairman Heath P. Tarbert and links to statements from individual commissioners.Market manipulation inflicts real pain on farmers by denying them the fair value of their hard work and crops, Tarbert said in his statement. It also hurts American families by raising the costs of putting food on the table. Instances of market manipulation are precisely the kinds of cases the CFTC was founded to pursue.The CFTC told the court Saturday that its public statements didnt violate the order and that its individual commissioners were not bound by the agreement. The CFTC voluntarily removed the announcement from its website until the next court appearance.The CFTC and Kraft declined to comment for this article. Mondelez did not respond to a request for comment.The segments of Kraft and Mondelez named as defendants in the case were part of the same company in 2011 when the trades took place. In 2012, Kraft Foods changed its name to Mondelez and spun off Kraft Foods Group Inc., which merged with Heinz in 2015 to form the Kraft Heinz Co.Krafts futures position in 2011 represented 87% of the active futures market for that particular month and type of wheat, according to the CFTC. The agency accused the company of taking this position to try to lower the price of wheat in the spot market where it was buying the grain.With Kraft signaling to the market that it intended to change its normal plan and buy wheat through the futures market instead of the spot market, the price of wheat in the futures market rose and the cash price fell, allowing Kraft to reap a profit, according to the complaint.When the company bought wheat in the spot market and unwound a large portion of its futures position, it generated a gain of more than $5 million, according to the CFTC.Some companies are allowed to file for exemptions to the caps on futures positions for hedging purposes. The CFTC said Kraft did not have an exemption and that its futures position represented a six-month supply of the wheat it needed at its Toledo area-flour mill and was not for legitimate business purposes.The regulator also said Kraft performed illegal offsetting trades of futures contracts with itself.Kraft has been one of the worst-performing large cap stocks in 2019, shedding more than 40% of its share price this year. The stock of Mondelez International, the parent company of the defendant in this suit, is up more than 35% this year.Clarification: The headline of this article was changed to clarify that Kraft hasnt filed a new lawsuit against the CFTC. The company filed a contempt motion in an already existing lawsuit by the agency.
New York Gov. Cuomo says state wont return to normal#New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday that the coronavirus outbreak could stabilize within weeks if the state maintains strict social distancing policies, even as he announced the highest daily death count yet and said life for New Yorkers will never be the same.I dont think we return to normal. I dont think we return to yesterday, Cuomo said at a news conference in Albany. I think if were smart, we achieve a new normal.The governor offered a glimmer of hope that the states stringent policies — closing nonessential businesses and requiring residents to stay home — are helping to slow down the spread of the virus.Those social distancing measures are working, he said: It is flattening the curve.If those rules are maintained, he said, theres reason to believe the health system should stabilize over these next couple of weeks.The coronavirus pandemic continues to hammer the Empire State, new figures showed. New York reported 10,453 new cases Wednesday, comprising 4,927 positive tests in New York City and 5,526 in the rest of the state.Half of all tests in two New York City boroughs – Queens and the Bronx – came back positive, the state reported.Cuomo said the state appears to be flattening the curve of the outbreak, referring to a line chart that projects the growth in new cases over time. But he quickly added that would only last if people continue to adhere to social distancing guidelines. If we stop what we are doing, you will see that curve change, Cuomo said.The bad news, he said, isnt just bad. The bad news is actually terrible.Cuomo announced that 779 people had died from the virus since the last count, marking the states highest daily death toll yet.New York is the epicenter of the COVID-19 crisis in the United States, with 140,386 confirmed cases and more than 5,489 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Halftime: Get Into Goldman Ahead Of Spin-Off?#According to CNBC’s Kate Kelly, Goldman Sachscould spin off at least part of its proprietary trading operations as early as this month.The move comes in the wake of new rules that limit Wall Street firms from betting their own money in financial markets.Though details are still sketchy, a couple of options are on the table. One is to seed a hedge fund staffed by former Goldman proprietary traders with Goldman money and replace it in the coming years with third party money as the new rule goes into effect. Another possibility is to move proprietary trading into the firms asset management unit, where Goldman invests clients money rather than its own.How should you trade Goldman in the wake of this news?Instant Insights with the Fast Money tradersI think this is a reason to buy, says Jon Najarian. I like the idea of a spin-off. The move allows Goldman to retain intellectual capital and not have restrictions on the work it does best, muses Joe Terranova. I’m bullish.Also, keep in mind the performance of the capital markets in July was very strong and that should bode well for Goldman’s earnings in October. On top of that, from a technical perspective, I think the stock is poised to break out. Right now is a good spot to get in.
China offers development fund for Solomon Islands if it breaks#China is offering to bankroll a development fund for the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific if it switches diplomatic ties from Taiwan to Beijing, a parliamentary committee in the small island nation has heard.The proposal, which would replace a similar structure set-up by Taiwan, comes amid a global push by Beijing to peel away the allies of what it considers a wayward province with no right to state-to-state ties. Only 17 countries now recognize Taiwan.China and Taiwan have fought a tug-of-war for diplomatic recognition in the South Pacific for decades, with some island nations switching allegiances for financial gain.John Moffat Fugui, a Solomons parliamentarian and head of a taskforce charged with evaluating diplomatic ties, said on Wednesday that Beijing would pay into a fund even though it usually preferred grants, concessionary loans and sometimes gifts.But for you, we will give you a 1/8Rural Constituency Development Fund 3/8 for a certain period, Fugui said, referring to recent negotiations with Beijing officials.Fugui said the offer would help fill an immediate gap should the Solomons cut ties with Taiwan that date back to 1983.Taiwan has pledged $8.5 million to the Solomons in 2019-20 through a fund, budget documents show.The Solomons, an archipelago of just over 600,000 people, relies heavily on such payments due to its limited means of generating income, which is largely through timber exports.The South Pacific has been a diplomatic stronghold for Taiwan, where formal ties with six of the 16 island nations make up more than a third of its total alliances.A report by the Australia-based Lowy Institute think-tank last month said: Both Australia and the U.S. are concerned about whether Solomon Islands chooses to switch recognition from Taiwan to China. It said a switch by any one (of the states that recognize Taiwan) may stimulate others to abandon Taipei.Fugui spoke positively about a potential switch in ties at a parliamentary committee in the capital of Honiara on Wednesday, although he said the taskforce had not yet completed its report.Separately, the government has convened a ministerial team that has been liaising directly with Beijing.An observer at the meetings told Reuters that: The government is trying to make a relationship with China now; but to formalize it we need to wait for the report. The meeting was open to the public, but has not been broadcast.Chinas foreign ministry in Beijing did not immediately respond to questions.Joanne Ou, spokeswoman for Taiwans foreign ministry, said: Relationship with Solomon Islands currently is stable, but we are closely monitoring and situation and development.Solomon Islands has been actively assessing its Taiwan alliance since a general election in April.Anti-graft agency Transparency Solomon Islands has urged caution in changing ties over concerns Solomons will not be able to hold firm against Beijings interests.It is not a secret that China is the most assertive donor nation offering funding and development assistance that exploit governance gaps in countries with weak or corrupt structures, and makes the gaps wider, Transparency Solomon Islands said in a statement last month.The number of nations recognizing Taiwan has been dwindling, with El Salvador in Central America, Burkina Faso in West Africa and the Dominican Republic in the Caribbean, all switching to China last year.
China responds to Trump tariffs with proposed list of 128#The worlds second-largest economy has responded to President Donald Trumps controversial trade tariffs.Chinas commerce ministry proposed a list of 128 U.S. products as potential retaliation targets, according to a statement on its website posted Friday morning.The U.S. goods, which had an import value of $3 billion in 2017, include wine, fresh fruit, dried fruit and nuts, steel pipes, modified ethanol, and ginseng, the ministry said. Those products could see a 15 percent duty, while a 25 percent tariff could be imposed on U.S. pork and recycled aluminium goods, according to the statement.The statement did not go into greater detail. U.S. agricultural products, particularly soybeans, have been flagged as the biggest area of potential retaliation by Chinese President Xi Jinpings administration.

Former employees file class action against Wells Fargo#Two former Wells Fargo  employees have filed  a class action in California seeking $2.6 billion or more for  workers who tried to meet aggressive sales quotas without  engaging in fraud and were later demoted, forced to resign or  fired.  The lawsuit on behalf of people who worked for Wells Fargo in  California over the past 10 years, including current employees,  focuses on those who followed the rules and were penalized for  not meeting sales quotas.  Wells Fargo fired or demoted employees who failed to meet  unrealistic quotas while at the same time providing promotions to  employees who met these quotas by opening fraudulent accounts,  the lawsuit filed on Thursday in California Superior Court in Los  Angeles County said.  Wells Fargo has fired some 5,300 employees for opening as many as  2 million accounts in customers names without their  authorization. On Sept. 8, a federal regulator and Los Angeles  prosecutor announced a $190 million settlement with Wells.  The revelations are a severe hit to Wells Fargos reputation.  During the financial crisis, the bank trumpeted being a  conservative bank in contrast with its rivals.  A Wells Fargo spokesman on Saturday declined to comment on the  lawsuit.  The lawsuit accuses Wells Fargo of wrongful termination, unlawful  business practices and failure to pay wages, overtime, and  penalties under California law.  Former employees Alexander Polonsky and Brian Zaghi allege Wells  Fargo managers pressed workers to meet quotas of 10 accounts per  day, required progress reports several times daily and  reprimanded workers who fell short.

Problems at Japanese company Minebea have affected production of  the iPhone 6s Pluss backlight and could lead to a shortage when it goes on sale Sept. 25, analyst  Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities said in a note obtained by the  website.Apple placed rush orders with another supplier, Radiant,  to resolve the issue, according to the report.
Did Kim just bail Kanye out of his $53M ‘debt’?#It appears Kanye Wests alleged debt burden may have just been  lifted, with the help of wife and fellow celebrity, Kim  Kardashian West.  On Monday night, the reality TV personality tweeted  that she was busy cashing (her) 80 million video game check, and transferring $53 million into a joint account.

These food company stocks are a better way to play#Wall Street still has an appetite for fake meat.Beyond Meat rose nearly 7% on Tuesday after J.P. Morgan upgraded the meat-alternative stock to an overweight rating, citing valuation after a pullback from its highs.However, Boris Schlossberg, managing director at BK asset management, isnt firing up the grill just yet.I think the way to play is actually through the retail stores, Schlossberg said Tuesday on CNBCs Trading Nation.Beyond Meat has risen over 500% since its early May IPO, but has dropped nearly 40% off its late July high.My favorite is actually Dunkin Donuts, which has been really highlighting Beyond Meat and the Beyond Egg sandwich very well and has also done a very good job merchandising, said Schlossberg. That stock has also been a very strong momentum stock, but I still think its the right way to play it because its done a very good end-around McDonalds and Starbucks, and I think it has some very, very strong momentum going forward.Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer, agrees food retailers would be a better play.We would prefer the food servers over the food suppliers, and the restaurant industry in general is really broadly strong here when were talking about McDonalds, Starbucks, Wingstop, Dunkin Brands, Wendys and Restaurant Brands, thats what were looking for, those broad based themes, said Wald.All those names are outperforming the S&P this year, and Wald says Wendys is showing signs of relative strength.Our analyst recently raised his target to $24 after recent management meetings, and the charts are supportive to really classic breakout here, said Wald. The stock got through $18 in April, came back tested that breakout in August, now turning higher again, new high in this mixed market tape, we see that as a sign of relative strength.Wendys has soared 5% in the past week even as the S&P 500 has fallen 1%. It is up 32% in 2019.Disclaimer
Irene Wounding Weekend Box Office#Hurricane Irene and the closure of at least 1,000 theater locations along the East Coast is expected to put a dent in this weekends domestic box office.
Review: The 2019 Toyota Tundra pickup fails to impress#The full-size pickup truck market has never been hotter, with Fiat Chryslers Ram and General Motors Chevy duking it out second place in sales behind Ford. All three big American companies are constantly refreshing their lineups to cling to any advantages over the competition.Thats big trouble for Toyota, which hasnt completely redesigned its Tundra pickup since 2007. Its received a slew of updates and a large refresh in 2014, but sales have always lagged behind the big three in Detroit. In a segment of six, the Tundra is the fifth-place finisher, besting only Nissans Titan in sales.After a week with one, its not hard to see why. Its well built and isnt as pricey as the American trucks, but we still wouldnt recommend one.
Bowyer: Who Am I To Judge The Case For Global#Last week I was a guest on Larry Kudlow’s Saturday morning radio program (on WABC, New York). A man called the program and said that some of these surveys which claim scientific support for the global warming hypothesis, contained some decidedly unclimatolgical signatures from pediatricians, gynecologists or just about anybody else with a terminal degree. In other words the case against oil was a little slipperier than reported. “Gynecologists against drilling?”, I thought, “Seems like there must be some kind of conflict of interest here. I need to learn more.”
Health-care maze remains for undocumented immigrants#President Obamas executive order preventing the deportation of  up to 5 million undocumented immigrants wont preclude all of  them from getting affordable health coverage. But it remains to  be seen just how many will be presented with that option.   Even if a good amount do get insurance, the health, social  and economic costs from having the remaining immigrants  effectively locked out of health coverage will remain a problem,  say advocates and analysts.  And some of those  costs—including visits to  emergency rooms that arent paid by  insurance—could end up getting  passed along to the general public, they noted.  Undocumented immigrants, who currently comprise one in every six  people in the United States without health insurance, by 2017 are  projected to make up 1 in 4 such uninsured people, said Stephen  Zuckerman, co-director of the Health Policy Center at the Urban  Institute.  Zuckerman noted that its not because there will be more  undocumented immigrants without insurance. Instead, he said, its because there will be significantly more  currently uninsured people overall getting insured in the coming  years through Obamacare insurance plans and from Medicaid,  particularly in states that have expanded eligibility for  Medicaid to include more people.  But both those options will essentially be blocked to the people  subject to Obamas order last week, which lifts the threat of  deportation and will give those people the ability to work  legally in the U.S. Read MoreCat got your tongue,  HealthCare.gov?  The White House has indicated it will not allow such  undocumented people access to federal subsidies that help most  Obamacare enrollees afford policies sold on government-run  insurance exchanges. And those people will also be barred by  federal law from enrolling in Medicaid, the joint  federal-state program that covers poor people.
As it happened: China stocks stage late rally; up 4%#Squawk Box Live in Europe kept you up to date with Chinas stock markets, which staged a late rally Wednesday. This came as investors geared up for another bumper day of earnings and the conclusion of this months Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting.
Will Markets Fed Rally Continue?#The stock market rallied midday Wednesday following the Federal  Reserves announcement of more bond buying, but will it  continue?   This does look like its going to be a long-term prognosis,  OptionMonsters Pete Najarian said on Fast Money.  Specifically, the Feds bond-buying and continued low interest  rates would benefit the financial sector, he added.  The rally in stocks suggested that Washington lawmakers would  strike a budget deal to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff, which would trigger tax  hikes and automatic spending cuts on Jan. 1, Stephen Weiss of  Short Hills Capital said.  Youre looking for talk of a grand bargain at this point, he  said. Youve increased the risk dramatically to your portfolio  with the way the markets risen.  Rosecliff Capitals Mike Murphy said the midday pop in the  S&P 500 to 1,435 was  significant and set up for a new level of resistance at 1,450.  The Fed action signaled that it was safe to get back into stocks,  he added.   I think the market continues to rally.

Cramer’s Sell-Off Playbook#As horrible as they may seem, sell-offs are inevitable, Cramer said. But instead of panicking when a downturn happens, investors should see opportunity.There’s always a bull market somewhere, and there are opportunities in every market. That’s especially the case during a correction because stocks go on sale when the market drops. So instead of gnashing their teeth for not sidestepping a sell-off – an “amateurish pipedream,” Cramer called it – investors should take the chance to buy great companies on the cheap.This is why Cramer recommended having at least 5% of a portfolio in cash. So investors are ready when it’s time to pounce. If stocks have had a bigger run than usual, meaning some type of correction could be coming, 10% might be better. The bottom line: Big declines will always happen. But smart investors with readily available cash can take advantage of them.Questions for Cramer?

Powerful and dangerous Hurricane Ida is on the verge of#Hurricane Ida was on the verge of making landfall in the United States on Sunday as an extremely dangerous Category 4 storm that could plunge much of the Louisiana shoreline underwater as the state grapples with a Covid-19 surge already taxing hospitals.Ida gathered more strength overnight, faster than meteorologists had predicted only a day ago. It is the toughest test yet for the hundreds of miles of new levees built around New Orleans after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, which made landfall 16 years ago to the day, inundating historically Black neighborhoods and killing more than 1,800 people.Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said that the storm, due to make landfall by Sunday afternoon, could be the states worst direct hit by a hurricane since the 1850s.The state is also dealing with the nations third-highest rate of new COVID-19 infections, with about 3,400 new cases reported on Friday alone. Hospitals were treating some 2,450 COVID-19 patients, Edwards said, with those in many of the states parishes already nearing capacity.By early Sunday, Ida was a Category 4 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. At 11 a.m. CDT (1600 GMT) it was located about 60 miles (95 km) west-southwest of the mouth of the Mississippi River, and some 85 miles (135 km) south of New Orleans, carrying top sustained winds of 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).Rain gusted through New Orleans on Sunday morning, where retired 68-year-old Robert Ruffin had evacuated with his family to a downtown hotel from their home in the citys east.I thought it was safer, he said. Its double trouble this time because of COVID.IDAs landfall was only a few hours away, according to the NHC, which warned of life-threatening storm surges, potentially catastrophic wind damage and flooding rainfall.Were as prepared as we can be, but were worried about those levees, said Kirk Lepine, president of Plaquemines Parish on the states Gulf Coast.Plaquemines is one of the most vulnerable parishes, where 23,000 people live along the Mississippi delta stretching into the Gulf. Lepine feared levees along Highway 23 were not up to task.Water could go over top, he said. Thats our one road in and out.Edwards told CNN on Sunday that he believed the states levees would be able to withstand the storm surge, though he expressed some doubt about parishes, like Plaquemines, in the south.Where were less confident is further south where you have other protection systems that are not built to that same standard, he said. Thats where we are most concerned about the impact of storm surge.He said on Saturday there were no plans to evacuate patients from hospitals, and that state officials had been speaking with hospitals to ensure their generators were working and that they had more water on hand than normal.Officials ordered widespread evacuations of low-lying and coastal areas, jamming highways and leading some gasoline stations to run dry as residents and vacationers fled.This is a powerful and dangerous storm. It is moving faster than we had thought it would be, so we have a little less time to prepare, said Dr. Joseph Kanter, Louisianas chief medical official. There is a lot of Covid out there, there are a lot of risks out there.
When you can expect to receive the $600 stimulus check#Now that President Donald Trump has signed off on the $900 billion coronavirus relief bill, many Americans can expect to receive a second stimulus check in the coming weeks, a welcome development for households across the country that could not afford to celebrate this holiday season.As of last week, direct deposits from the IRS were expected to hit bank accounts before Dec. 31, with paper checks and debit cards sent out to all eligible households by Jan. 15. But with the presidents delay in signing the bill, the payments may take slightly longer to arrive.Dont miss: The best 0% APR credit cards with no interest for up to 20 monthsThat said, it is possible that direct deposits could still start being deposited under the same timeline, as soon as this week, according to a spokesman for Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., since the Treasury Department was already preparing to make the payments under the assumption that the bill would be signed last week.Treasury did not immediately return a request for comment, but an official told CNBC that the timeline is expected to be the same.
The Feds economic forecasts are all over the map, a#The Federal Reserves economic outlook isnt so much pessimistic as it is uncertain, with expectations running a wide gamut from a plodding recovery to a sharp rebound.If that sounds a lot like the market lately, its probably not a coincidence.Following its two-day meeting earlier this week, the Fed released its Summary of Economic Projections for GDP, unemployment, inflation and interest rates. The estimates largely reflected the current unprecedented downturn followed by expectations for varying levels of growth ahead. Specifically on GDP, which measures goods and services produced and is the broadest yardstick for economic growth, the median figures in each of the three years for which estimates were provided masked wide disparities of views from the policymaking Federal Open Market Committees 17 members.For 2020, the median expectation was for a GDP decline of 6.5%. But that was merely the midpoint of forecasts that ranged all the way from -10% to -4.2%. The difference gets even more pronounced in 2021, where the median is a 5% gain but the range goes from -1% — in essence, a continuation of the recession that started in February 2020 — to a 7% gain, which would be the fastest one-year growth rate since 1984.The outlook for unemployment and inflation all showed a substantial disparity of opinions.
With bitcoin ticking over $28,000, now might be a good#Sitting on a growing bitcoin fortune? Consider giving away some of it to charity.As 2020 draws to a close, the cryptocurrency has seen a massive surge in appreciation. The value of a single unit of bitcoin is now hovering around $28,000.Though longtime holders of the virtual currency are rejoicing, they run the risk of winding up overweight in bitcoin. That is, the massive run-up in values could suddenly result in investors having more exposure toward bitcoin — and its risks — than theyd like.Similarly, while cashing out of your holdings might seem attractive, it could come with a hefty capital gains tax bill on the appreciation.More from Advisor Insight:How financial advisors say to use your $600 stimulus checkHeres whos likely eligible for a second stimulus checkCovid relief bill adds PPP tax breaks the Treasury opposedThats where charitable giving comes into play.We believe in asset diversification, and because the price of bitcoin rose significantly, investors could be overallocated based on their targets for their portfolio, said Stefan Podvojsky, senior vice president of Fidelity Charitable.A donor advised fund provides a great outlet to remove that overweight and support the philanthropy that is important to the donor, he said.Indeed, investors in bitcoin have been able to donate their holdings to donor-advised funds via Fidelity Charitable since 2015.

Bitcoin could be used to hide assets in divorces, warn#Bitcoin, the electronic currency, could be used by  divorcing spouses to hide assets from estranged partners, lawyers  have said, as court battles shift their focus to the disclosure  of assets.  Divorce settlements in England are seen as particularly generous  to ex-wives, because judges recognize the equal contributions  made by the breadwinner and the homemaker in a marriage, and  divide the assets equally.  Moreover, courts are increasingly having to deal with legal  battles brought by one side claiming the other has not made full  disclosure of assets and has concealed wealth. Read MoreMarc Andreessen in bitcoin for  the long run  Ayesha Vardag, a London divorce lawyer, has warned that more  lawyers may start including digital currencies in financial  disclosure orders if there is evidence they have been used.  They can be used to run a parallel economy, she said. People  will go to immense lengths . . . as a spousal  claim is more damaging than tax because it is half your wealth.  Already, a number of forums devoted to Bitcoin discussion have  seen husbands exploring the option of using digital currencies,  she said.Read MoreDish to becomelargest company to accept bitcoin  Bitcoins provide relative anonymity to investors and, unlike bank  accounts and share holdings, they are hard to link to an  individual.  For this reason, the currency has become a mainstay of illicit  transactions, such as through Silk Road, the now-closed online  drugs and weapons marketplace.  Although traditional currency holdings – in US dollars or  euros for example – might need to be declared as part of the  asset disclosure process, parties could try to hide their wealth  by converting it to Bitcoins.
How traders cashed in big on the GE deal#Some savvy traders stand to make millions off Fridays General Electric deal as a result of some  very well-timed options trades.   On Thursday, when GE stock was trading around $25, traders  starting aggressively buying the April 26-strike calls for around  33 cents each. A call purchase is a bullish bet that a stock will  rise a certain amount within a set time. All told, nearly  18,000 of those calls traded. GE shares rallied 8 percent Friday  after the company announced it will sell its finance arm and buy  back stock. With the advance, those call options are now worth $2  each, a sixfold increase that created an instant windfall for the  buyers.
Here are the top 10 major worries for global business#Cybersecurity, health of the global economy, energy price shock and terrorist attacks are some of the top risks that concern businesses and may threaten their ability to operate, according to results from a new survey by the World Economic Forum (WEF) published Wednesday.The survey, conducted annually by the WEFs strategic partners Marsh & McLennan Companies and Zurich Insurance Group, highlighted the following ten risks that businesses are presently concerned about:While concerns about the overall health of the global economy continue to dominate the list, the report found concerns around cybersecurity risks rising in importance.Business leaders in many of worlds largest economies now rank cyber as their top risk, John Drzik, president of Marsh Global Risk & Digital, said in a press statement. Companies need to rigorously analyze how these threats could impact their operations and take appropriate risk mitigation and resiliency measures.
Wal-Mart A Year Later: High Prices Now Bring In Customers#A year ago Wal-Mart management said that high gas prices were hurting their customers and store sales.Now, a year later, gas prices are even higher and Wal-Mart management says those expensive costs are bringing customers into its stores. So I asked CEO Lee Scott where the tipping point in terms of changing consumer behavior. His answer was an interesting one. Scott said it was undeniable that Wal-Marts core customers were the first ones impacted by the spike in gasoline prices and they bought less. What changed? Scott said two things: (1) Wal-Mart improved its store experience (cleaned up aisles, added brands to its merchandise and refocused on retail) and (2) the economic stress spread from the bottom up and brought in new customers at the right time (i.e. After Wal-Mart improved stores.) Scott said that this trend doesnt mean that business will fall off when the economy improves. Wal-Mart executives also made it clear that theyre interested in expanding health care and green initiatives. In other words, theyre trying to anticipate where product trends are headed and carve out a low cost niche to feed developing needs.
Paul Singer: Cushion to withstand risks is very low#Paul Singer thinks the recent dramatic move in the Swiss  franc—and resulting losses—shows just how exposed most  investors are to market risk.Given the pricing and the still opaque and over-levered financial system, the sensitivity ... to risks is extremely high ... and the cushion  to withstand risks is very low, the founder of Elliott Management said at the World Economic  Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday.
Media Companies, Seeing Profit Slip, Push Into Education#As another academic year starts, about 500,000 children across the country will find themselves learning subjects like middle school history or high school biology from a new line of digital textbooks. These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher. Instead it has the support of Discovery, the cable TV company.
Retailer Grows Up, Along With His Business#34-year-old professional skier Bryce Phillips had a vision to create a retail experience for the active sport enthusiast that would embrace their lifestyle and their values.In 2005, he launched Evo, an online and brick-and-mortar retail business that caters to skiers and boarders. Retail is just one part of the business. He also engages the community through events such as art openings, film premieres, and skate competitions at the Seattle headquarters. Evo, short for “evolution”, is how Phillips thinks about his business: always changing to stay relevant. And indeed, his company evolved from a one-man business selling merchandise from liquidators at the age of 12, to a full-fledged business with 120 employees.Phillips talks about how Evo got its start,why it has thrived, and where he plans on taking the company from here.
HKs white collar workers have a dim view of 2016#Political tension with Beijing, high property prices, and an economic slowdown in mainland China have dimmed Hong  Kongs growth outlook for 2016 according to the citys white  collar workers, a new study has found.Professional accounting body CPA Australia, which polled Hong  Kong-based professionals working in public and private companies,  government and other not-for-profit organizations, found 53  percent of respondents described themselves as pessimistic about  the regions prospects – a 13 percent increase in gloomy  respondents compared to the year before. Just 9 percent said they saw the economic outlook as positive,  while 34 percent said it was satisfactory.Almost a third believed Hong Kongs gross domestic product (GDP),  the widest measure of economic growth, would expand by between  1-1.9 percent next year; this was a 7 percent decline in the  number that expected similarly positive growth in the CPAs 2014  poll. According to the new poll, 25 percent said GDP growth would  decline in 2016, a 13 percent rise in the number of pessimistic  votes on the year preceding.
London mayor: Terrorists hate our way of life#Londons first Muslim mayor said Americans cant let terrorists  scare them into changing the way they live their lives.  We have to recognize that what these terrorists hate about us is  our way of life. We respect each other. We embrace each other. We  celebrate each other, Sadiq Khan said in an interview on CNBCs  Closing Bell.  He explained that terrorists hate the social and religious  diversity of global cities like London and New York City.  Fortunately, these kind of attacks dont happen daily because law  enforcement work their socks off to prevent them, Khan said.  He made his comments in the wake of explosions in New York and  New Jersey. Earlier on Monday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said that  this was an act of terror. The FBI said, however, that there is no  reason to believe a terror cell is operating here.  Two senior officials have now confirmed to NBC News that Ahmad  Khan Rahami was not on a U.S. terrorist watchlist or an NYPD  list. NBC News also reported that U.S. Intelligence does not have  any information indicating connections between the suspects  family and known terrorist groups or individuals.
Rolling Stone Boston bomber photo stirs debate; CVS drops the#Rolling Stone magazine sparked a heated social media debate today  after releasing a cover image promoting an upcoming profile of  alleged Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.   The Twitter and Facebook firestorm resulted in calls for boycotts, and drugstore chain CVS announcing that it would not carry the  issue in its 7,000 stores nationwide.  As a company with deep roots in New England and a strong  presence in Boston, we believe this is the right decision out of  respect for the victims of the attack and their loved ones, the  statement said. CVS is headquartered in Woonsocket, R.I.  The cover, released online as a preview to Fridays edition with  an in-depth article chronicling Tsarnaevs life leading up to the  Boston Marathon bombing, features a selfie—or self-taken  photo—by Tsarnaev with the teens hair falling across his face.  Some online noted that the photo called to mind previous Rolling  Stone covers of Jim Morrison or Bob Dylan and glorified the  teenage suspected killer. Others pointed out that the photo had  also appeared on major news sites like The New York Times in the  days after Tsarnaevs capture.  This is obviously a big story and there are a lot of people who  are going to be interested in it, but in my mind it isnt  deserving of the cover, said Duran Fernandez-OBrien, who lives  in Boston and joined the Boycott Rolling Stone Magazine for  their latest cover Facebook page.  Tsarnaev is suspected of setting off two bombs at the Boston  Marathon with his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, on April 15.  At his first public appearance since his arrest, Tsarnaev pleaded  not guilty to 30 charges brought against him by federal  prosecutors in the U.S. District Court.  Fernandez-OBrien echoed other online critics, voicing concern  over whether the magazine is glorifying Tsarnaev and his actions  by giving him so much attention.Obviously its what people want to see, he said. Definitely. But at the  same time it creates a culture where people who may be on the  fringe of thinking about doing something like that will then push  forward and go through their ideas because they think this will  make me famous: I will leave my mark history if I do something  like this.

Occupy London marks anniversary of St Pauls camp#LONDON -- Supporters of Occupy have gathered outside St. Pauls Cathedral to mark the first anniversary of the anti-corporate movements now-dismantled protest camp.Hundreds of protesters against capitalist excess and social inequality set up camp outside Christopher Wrens famous landmark on Oct. 15, 2011, after they were stopped from demonstrating outside the nearby London Stock Exchange.The tent city embroiled the historic church in a conflict between bank-bashing demonstrators and the citys finance industry. The churchs position on the protesters shifted several times, and the cathedrals dean and a senior priest both resigned over the issue.The camp was dismantled in February after the protesters lost a court battle with local authorities.Activist Ronan McNern said Saturday that the movement was still necessary because the problem of inequality is not going away.
Jim Cramer says Chevron looks attractive thanks to its dividend,#Investors who want to buy an energy stock as the price of oil slides should look to Chevron, CNBCs Jim Cramer said Thursday.Heres a stock that everyone seemed to just be gaga about a few weeks ago, and now it cant get any love, the Mad Money host said of Chevron. The stocks fallen from $113 to $94, but at these levels it sports a 5.7% yield. I like Chevron very much.An attractive dividend is the primary reason to consider owning an oil stock right now, Cramer suggested.Outside of Chevron, Cramer said two other oil plays that carry slightly more risk are Devon and Pioneer Natural Resources. While both companies have solid variable dividends, he stressed that their payouts could shrink as oil comes down.The price of crude slid in recent weeks and on Thursday closed in the red for the sixth-straight session, touching its lowest level since May.The U.S. oil benchmark, West Texas Intermediate crude futures, dropped 2.7% to settle at $63.69 per barrel. Brent crude, which is the international benchmark, declined about 2% to just under $67 per barrel.After a red-hot start to the year, oil has faced weakness due, in part, to concerns about slowing demand as the coronavirus pandemic persists around the world. Comments this week about a potential change to the Federal Reserves highly accommodative monetary policy also caused the U.S. dollar to strengthen. That can end up hurting oil because it makes crude more costly for overseas buyers.In July, as WTI traded above $72 per barrel, Cramer said he believed oil had put in its near-term top. He said Thursday more weakness could be ahead, as an increase in supply clashes with a slump in demand. Investors who are looking to buy an oil stock need to be mindful of that, Cramer said.Be careful, because oil ... may not be done rolling over yet, he said. I dont know if oil can even hold above $60 these days. Most American producers are still plenty profitable above $60, but below that level, it does start to get more dicey.
Chevron shares jump, extending gains on Credit Suisse upgrade after#Shares of Chevron are posting a second day of strong gains, bolstered by an upgrade at Credit Suisse, after the energy giant raised its outlook for oil and gas production on Friday and reported quarterly earnings that topped Wall Streets expectations.Chevrons stock price jumped more than 3.5 percent, to about $119, on Monday, bringing its two-day gain to roughly 7 percent. The shares are still down about 5 percent this year, roughly in line with the loss for the broader S&P 500 energy sector.Chevron reported a $4 billion profit for the third quarter of 2018, more than double its earnings during the same period a year ago. The San Ramon, California-based company pumped at a record level last quarter, and executives said they now expect to hit the upper range of their guidance for oil and gas output for the year.Credit Suisse on Monday upgraded the companys stock to outperform from neutral. The investment bank maintained its price target of $138 on the shares.The bank said Chevron continues to execute on its already superior growth outlook, even as its stock trades at a wider than normal discount to fellow U.S.-headquartered oil major Exxon Mobil.Chevron now says it expects its oil and gas production to grow at the top end of its previously forecast range of 4 percent to 7 percent.That should yield better capital efficiency in 2018 and boost free cash flow, in Credit Suisses view. Healthier cash flow will allow Chevrons management to reward investors with a competitive quarterly dividend payment and potentially expand its $3 billion per year share buyback program, the bank said.The engine behind Chevrons growing output is its Wheatstone and Gorgon natural gas projects in Australia, the Permian Basin underlying Texas and New Mexico and several offshore projects, according to Credit Suisse.
Merkel would be dream EU Commission president, Luxembourgs PM says#German Chancellor Angela Merkel has received another glowing endorsement to be a future president of the European Commission — this time from Luxembourg.Luxembourgs Prime Minister Xavier Bettel told CNBC that Merkel would be a dream candidate for the presidency of Europes executive body.I love that idea, Ive asked Angela Merkel several times. She would be a perfect candidate for the (European) Council, for the Commission, Bettel told CNBCs Silvia Amaro in Luxembourg Thursday.Shes got a global view, shes a great leader and a strong personality. I really, really appreciate Angela Merkel …. I really, really think she would be a great leader for Europe. We have some different candidates who are able but Angela for me would be a dream candidate.Bettels comments come after French President Emmanuel Macron said that he would support Merkel as the next president of the European Commission once Jean-Claude Juncker leaves the post on November 1.On Tuesday, Macron told Swiss broadcaster RTS that If she were to want it (the post), I would support her.
Fords Lincoln plans to produce luxury SUV in China by#Ford Motors luxury unit Lincoln plans to produce luxury SUVs in China by late 2019, as it steps up its move into the worlds largest auto market and aims to catch up with German and U.S. rivals who already manufacture in the Asian nation.The plan is to build an all-new sports utility vehicle (SUV) to suit Chinese tastes, Lincoln China said in a statement. Ford plans to use an existing assembly plant it jointly operates with Chongqing Changan Automobile to produce the Lincoln vehicles, a Ford spokesman in Shanghai said.Lincoln vehicles are currently imported into China, and their sales have jumped nearly 180 percent in 2016, the statement said.The move to local production is a key next step in Lincolns evolution in China and will complement continued imports from North America, it said.The statement gave no other details about the plans. The Ford spokesman declined to give the models anticipated production volume or describe the model other than to say it is an SUV.The Changan-Ford joint venture is in the process of getting approval for this move to produce Lincoln vehicles locally in China, said the spokesman.Lincoln China President Amy Marentic told Reuters in October that the brand was studying whether to produce cars locally in China.Lincoln was accelerating its entry into China with plans to have 65 Lincoln stores by the end of 2016, instead of previous plans of 60, with 80 planned for year-end 2017, she said.Marentic said the company would also open five to 10 smaller sales branches to tap into fast-growing auto sales in lower-tier Chinese cities.
These companies might close, lay off US workers because of#The ongoing trade war President Donald Trump has waged against world powers, including some of our closest allies, doesnt show signs of slowing down.Left in the fray: Companies, American workers and consumers.The list of companies affected, either by planning to close plants, laying off employees, tossing out plans for new jobs or raising prices continues to grow.On Tuesday, the Trump administration announced it was escalating the battle with China by moving forward with a 25 percent tariff on $16 billion in Chinese goods. The tariffs will go into effect later this month.The end goal in Trumps eyes is for these countries to lower the tariffs they have on American goods, thus improving the market for the U.S. Some say his plan could work as the U.S. is negotiating from a position of strength -- a strong economy and low unemployment rates.But as the fight continues, some companies are having to absorb the blow. Several have raised prices or suffered lower profits while others announced the possible closing of plants, layoffs and halting plans to add jobs.More from USA Today: U.S. trade war with China, other countries: Layoffs, reduced hours, slimmer profitsTrump trade war: U.S. stock market is faring better than Chinas since dispute beganTariff winners and losers: How Trumps trade spat could affect shoppersHeres a list of some of the companies, sorted by state, who have announced effects from the tariffs:
Amanda Campbell: Compatent#Meet Amanda Campbell, 24 from Kingston. Shes a well-spoken  graduate from UCL, where she  studied interdisciplinary architecture.  She is also a huge music festival fan having attended more than  30 since her first one at the age of 16.   Her idea is Comp-A-Tent, a fully compostable tent. Its primary  use is for festivals, in order to counter the environmental  impact of leaving tents behind once the party is over. Simply,  you buy the tent with your festival ticket, pitch it, enjoy the  festival, then when its time to leave, you hand it into the  recycling bin area and it then decomposes at the same rate as  bread.   Her reasons for developing the tent came from personal  frustration from being at festivals and witnessing the number of  tents dumped, abandoned and otherwise left behind. She learned  that, on average, one in five tents are left behind at European  festivals, contributing over 750,000 tents every year to landfill  or incineration. These tents arent feasibly recycled, never  break down and leach hazardous toxins. It is a problem that  plagues festivals. At Glastonbury this year, the clear up  cost for organisers was £780,000 ($990,000).   From China, Amanda would like to source materials and  manufacturing for her pilot launch. Currently Amanda has been  making prototypes with a hand iron and it takes over one day per  tent. Amanda would like to find a factory in China with a faster  manufacturing process so that it can get down to the target price  of £40 per tent.

These 12 banks are the heart of monetary policy#The fed funds market is where officials set what is probably the worlds most  important interest rate—yet very few people  understand its current operations.This is the market at which the Federal Reserve directs its  primary energies.The Federal Open Markets Committee targets a  level or range for interest paid on overnight fed fund loans,  which are dollar-denominated loans of U.S. dollars between  financial institutions. The trading desk at the New York Fed buys  or sells Fed funds in order to get fed funds to trade at the  targeted level.In the textbook narrative about the fed funds market, some banks  borrow fed funds in order to meet their reserve requirements  while other banks lend fed funds in order to earn a return on  excess reserves. But this isnt quite right—and hasnt been  right since the financial crisis struck, as a new note from the  New York Fed shows.
S&P 500 closes at new record as chipmakers get a#U.S. stocks rose on Monday after the U.S. and China agreed to hold off on slapping additional tariffs on their products in an effort to resume trade talks.The  jumped 0.8% to 2,964.33, a record closing high. The broad index also reached an intraday record of 2,977.93. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 117.47 points, or 0.4%, to end the day at 26,717.43 as Nike and Apple outperformed. The Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.1% to 8,091.16 and posted a four-day winning streak.Chipmaker shares rose broadly. Skyworks Solutions gained 6% while Micron Technology advanced 3.9%. Shares of Qualcomm and Broadcom climbed 1.9% and 4.3%, respectively. Tech giant Apple also rose 1.8%.The markets appear to be content with the cooperative tone coming out of the meetings. To me, it felt like the contrarian play was to the upside post meetings, said Dan Deming, managing director at KKM Financial. There was a great deal of bearishness in sentiment headed into the meeting. Many market observers were discounting any change in the narrative, which made many believe the risk was to the downside.At its session high, the S&P 500 was up 1.2%. The Dow and Nasdaq rose as much as 290 points and 1.8% respectively.The major indexes started paring their gains around midday in New York. If it werent for the big gains from chipmakers and other technology stocks on the Huawei reprieve, it would likely be an average slightly higher market day in reaction to the trade truce.
Soccer phenom Carli Lloyd on protests, equal pay & leadership#While she supports Megan Rapinoe, soccer superstar  Carli Lloyd said her teammates recent silent protest during the  national anthem is an unwelcome distraction. The cause is great, the conversation is great, but I do think  there are more people talking about her actual kneeling and were  losing sight of what she is actually fighting for, Lloyd said. Thats  the unfortunate thing that is happening. Following in the footsteps of 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick,  Rapinoe has taken a knee during the national anthem in her last  two games, protesting racial inequality and police shootings of African-Americans.If it were me, I would protest in a different fashion, Lloyd  told CNBC during an interview about her new autobiography, When  Nobody Was Watching: My Hard-Fought Journey to the Top of the  Soccer World.The two-time Olympic gold medalist and co-captain of the U.S. womens national soccer team, also opened up about a number of other  issues from equal pay to her legacy and her teammates.
Sheryl Sandberg shares 3 ways men can empower women at#Sheryl Sandberg has been one of the loudest voices fighting for gender equality in the workplace. And yet, she says, women still face challenges in even the smallest workplace exchanges. In an interview with LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman for his podcast Masters of Scale, Sandberg discusses why some women still fear appearing too ambitious at work. That is because we do not embrace female leadership, she said. We just dont. We call little girls bossy. We do not call little boys bossy. We tell those same women they are too aggressive in the workplace. We rarely tell men, even though we know with gender blind studies that men, are in fact, on average more aggressive in the workplace and in other ways.

CEO pay is out of line: Jesse Ventura#The pay disparity between CEOs and workers is far too great  because few executives value physical labor,  former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura told CNBC on Tuesday.  We somehow diminish physical labor. We call that unskilled and  therefore we can pay so much more less for someone who has to  physically sweat and labor, digging a ditch, whatever it might  be,  Ventura said on Closing Bell. But where youre educated  and you push a pencil, well then you make big money.  Ventura clarified that CEOs have the right to pay themselves as  much as theyd like. He just hopes executives will recognize that  physical labor takes skill and should command decent pay.  Most CEOs are incapable of doing physical labor. They sit around  with suits on all day pushing pencils, said Ventura, who served  one term as an Independent governor of Minnesota from 1999 to  2003. CEO pay has gotten way out of line compared to the people  that work for them.  Ventura called on executives to pay physical laborers a living  wage, though he didnt specify what it might be. —By CNBCs Drew  Sandholm.
Commodities Help Bring New Lows For NASDAQ, S&P#Though it was another disappointing day, note that the Dow  was down 690 points at 3:40 PM ET and then rallied 170 points into the close. The S&P 500 and the NASDAQ  closed at new lows. Despite all the worries about redemptions and forced selling, volume was notably light until the last 45 minutes. It really was more of a buyers strike as bids simply got cancelled. That changed a bit in the last 45 minutes, as volume picked up a bit, but 6.1 billion shares for the NYSE is still moderate compared to recent activity. The primary impetus for the weakness was a commodity selloff: the dollar strength and global slowdown concerns created a negative feedback loop.

Video of the interview is available on  CNBC.com. All references must be sourced to CNBC. QUICK: AGAIN WE ARE LOOKING THROUGH THE NUMBERS ON THIS  DEAL AGAIN IT IS BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY BUYING PRECISION CASTPARTS  THIS IS A DEAL THAT THEY ARE VALUING AT 37 BILLION DOLLARS JUST  LOOKING AT THE PRESS RELEASE.  WARREN BUFFETT IS CALLING  INTO  THE CONTROL ROOM IS JUST A MINUTE THEY ARE PAYING $235  PER SHARE IN CASH THIS IS A STOCK THAT CLOSED AT $193.88 ON  FRIDAY SO WE WILL BE TALKING MUCH MORE ABOUT THIS.  I THINK  RIGHT NOW WE DO HAVE WARREN BUFFETT ON THE LINE. SIR ARE YOU  THERE? SO WE SEE THE NEWS THAT IS OUT TODAY THIS COMES AS A  SURPRISE TO A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT THE WALL STREET JOURNAL DID  REPORT THIS ON SATURDAY I WONDER WHEN DID YOU FIRST HEAR ABOUT  THIS, WHEN DID YOU FIRST TALK TO THIS COMPANY AND HOW DID THIS  DEAL HAPPEN? BUFFETT:  I WOULD SAY IS WAS ABOUT 5 WEEKS AGO.   YOU HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO TODD COMBS FOR THE DEAL WE HIRED TODD  ABOUT 5 YEARS AGO TO MANAGE MONEY AND HE MANAGES ABOUT 9 BILLION  NOW AND MAYBE THREE OR SO YEARS AGO  HE ADDED PRECISION TO  HIS PORTFOLIO AND I REALLY NEVER HEARD ABOUT THE COMPANY BEFORE  THAT AND TODD TOLD ME A LOT ABOUT IT AND OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS  I HAVE BECOME FAMILIAR WITH IT AND ABOUT 5 OR SO WEEKS AGO THE  CEO MARK DONEGAN ALONG WITH HIS CFO AND IR PERSON CAME BY  BERKSHIRE THEY WERE SEEING BERKSHIRE HOLDERS AND THEY MET WITH  TODD AND THEN I DROPPED IN ON THE VISIT AND IN THE LAST 15  MINUTES OR SO AND I WAS VERY IMPRESSED BY MARK AND OF COURSE I  HAD BEEN IMPRESSED BY THE COMPANY SO SHORTLY THEREAFTER I STOPPED  AND GIVE THEM A CALL TO SEE IF THEY WOULD BE OFFENDED IF WE MADE  A BID AND THEY DIDNT INDICATE THEY WERE PARTICULARLY RECEPTIVE  BUT THEY ALSO INDICATED THEY WOULD LISTEN SO I SUBSEQUENTLY MADE  A BID. I MET MARK OUT AT SUN VALLEY, HE WAS ACTUALLY IN THE AIR  MOST OF THE TIME AND SO HE CAME BY BECAUSE I WAS THERE FOR THE  ALLEN COMPANY CONFERENCE AND I MADE HIM A BID AND HE TOOK IT TO  THE BOARD AND BEFORE LONG WE HAD A DEAL. SORKIN:  WARREN I HAVE GOT TO TELL YOU I SAW BECKY THE  WEEK AFTER SUN VALLEY AND I SAID BUT WARREN IS DOING A DEAL I HAD  SEEN YOU AT SUN VALLEY. YOU HAD THAT PHONE WITH YOU SO INTENSE  THERE WAS SOMETHING GOING ON AND I THOUGHT I DIDNT REALIZE THIS  IS WHAT YOU WERE DOING.  BUFFETT: I WILL HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHEN I AM AROUND YOU  ANDREW IF YOU CAN READ MY FACE LIKE THAT.  SORKIN: FROM A PRICE PERSPECTIVE ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WE  HAD FROM AN EBITA I WAS DOING IT OFF OF THE $30 BILLION AND  THINKING THIS WAS ABOUT 20 TIMES EBITA WHICH I WAS SAYING NOT THE  CHEAPEST DEAL IN TOWN.  IT DOES ALLOW YOU TO SPEND A LOT OF  MONEY QUICKLY.  IN TERMS OF THE VALUATION THOUGH HOW DO YOU  THINK ABOUT IT AND WHEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT SPENDING THIS KIND  OF MONEY IS IT HARDER AND HARDER AS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER  TO ACTUALLY GET A REALLY CHEAP DEAL? BUFFETT: IT IS NOT 20 TIMES EBITA THOUGH ANDREW. I AM NOT  SURE WHAT FIGURES YOU ARE LOOKING AT THERE BUT ALL DEALS SEEM  EXPENSIVE TO ME BUT THIS ONE WE ARE CERTAINLY PAYING A VERY GOOD  PRICE FOR AN EXTRAORDINARY COMPANY RUN BY A PERSON THAN AS FAR AS  I AM CONCERNED HE IS THE BEST IN THE WORLD AT WHAT HE  DOES.  SORKIN: HES MADE A NUMBER OF DEALS OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF  YEARS ABOUT 8 BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF TRANSACTIONS WHEN YOU LOOK  AT THIS COMPANY OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS DO YOU IMAGINE  USING A LOT OF BERKSHIRE CASH TO MAKE ADDITIONAL ACQUISITIONS TO  USE IT AS A ROLL UP VEHICLE IF YOU WILL? BUFFETT: WELL ITS ALWAYS ACQUIRED COMPANIES I DONT KNOW  HOW MANY ACQUISITIONS THEY MADE OVER THE YEARS BUT IT IS A LOT.   BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT GO INTO AEROSPACE IN  THE WAY OF PARTS AND THEYVE GONE AFTER ONE ITEM AFTER ANOTHER  OVER THE YEARS.  IN FACT THEYVE MADE A COUPLE SMALL DEALS I  BELIEVE IN THE FIRST FISCAL QUARTER AND I THINK THEYVE GOT MAYBE  ONE PENDING OR SO.  NOW THEY MAKE A GOOD BIT OF MONEY SO  THEY WILL PROBABLY BE ABLE TO DO THE ACQUISITIONS OR MANY OF THE  ACQUISITIONS INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS BUT IF THEY NEED ANY  MONEY FROM BERKSHIRE ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS CALL.  QUICKLY: WARREN THIS IS AN EXPENSIVE DEAL IS THIS THE MOST  EXPENSIVE DEAL EVER?  HOW DOES IT MATCH UP TO BURLINGTON  NORTHERN? BUFFETT: WELL THE MOST DEALS ARE THE ONES THAT DONT WORK  OUT.  YOU MENTIONED DEXTER SHOE A LITTLE WHILE AGO. BUT IN  TERMS OF PRICE EARNINGS MULTIPLES GOING IN THIS IS RIGHT UP THERE  AT THE TOP NOW WHEN WE BOUGHT BURLINGTON THAT WAS A HIGH PE BUT  IT WAS OFF A VERY DEPRESSED FIGURE BECAUSE WE BOUGHT THAT IN THE  FALL OF 2009 WHEN EARNINGS WERE AT A TROUGH.  AND PRECISIONS  EARNINGS HAVE FALLEN OFF MODERATELY BECAUSE OF DEVELOPMENTS IN  THE OIL AND GAS FIELD WHERE THEY DO SOME BUSINESS AS WELL AS IN  AEROSPACE SO BUT THIS IS A VERY HIGH MULTIPLE FOR US. SULLIVAN: YOU READ MY MIND ON OIL AND GAS HOW MUCH OF THIS  IF AT ALL IS A BET THAT THE U.S. OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY MAY BE  BOTTOMING OUT AT LEAST FROM A PRICE PERSPECTIVE? BUFFETT: WELL WE ARE GOING TO BE IN THIS BUSINESS FOR A 100  YEARS SO IT DOESNT REALLY MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE WHAT OIL AND GAS  DOES IN THE NEXT YEAR IN TERMS OF US BUYING IT.  IF SOMEONE  TOLD ME FOR SURE THE OIL AND GAS BUSINESS WAS GOING TO BE IN THE  DULDRUMS WELL SAY FOR 3 YEARS I STILL WOULD HAVE MADE THE  DEAL.  THATS NOT A PREDICTION I AM JUST SAYING IT IS NOT  IMPORTANT TO US HOW LONG THE OIL AND GAS SLUMP LASTS WHEN YOU GET  A CHANCE TO BUY A WONDERFUL COMPANY YOU KNOW THERE IS USUALLY  SOME REASON WHY YOU ARE GETTING THAT CHANCE AND PERHAPS THE SLUMP  IN OIL AND GAS HELPS US IN THIS CASE.  BUT THERE WILL BE  SOMEDAY THERE WILL BE A SLUMP IN AEROSPACE AND THAT WILL BE MUCH  MORE SEVERE FOR A COMPANY LIKE THIS BUT IF YOU LOOK OVER THE  DECADES BOTH OIL AND GAS AND AEROSPACE WILL BE GOOD BUSINESS AND  THESE FELLOWS ARE THEIR KEY PARTICULARLY IN THE AEROSPACE  BUSINESS THE INDUSTRY NEEDS THEM THEYRE UNIVERSALLY REGARDED AS  THE MOST RELIABLE INNOVATIVE  DEPENDABLE SUPPLIER OF VERY  KEY PARTS THAT GO INTO ALL KINDS OF AIRCRAFTS.  SORKIN: WARREN SPEAK TO THE DEFENSIVE MODE THAT YOU OFTEN  TALK ABOUT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT PARTICULAR COMPANY IN TERMS OF  ITS MARKETSHARE AND ITS ABILITY TO MAINTAIN IF NOT GROW THAT  MARKETSHARE BUFFETT:  WELL WHAT YOU NEED IS YOU NEED PEOPLE THAT  HAVE PHYSICAL FACILITIES BUT THAT IS A SMALL PART OF IT.   THEY DO HAVE MARVELOUS PHYSICAL FACILITIES BUT WHAT YOU REALLY  NEED IS BRAIN POWER AND YOU NEED PARTICULARLY AT THE TOP YOU NEED  SOMEBODY WITH A TOTAL PASSION FOR THE BUSINESS AND IVE MET MARK  FOUR OR FIVE TIMES AND EACH TIME HES BEEN IN THE AIR AND HES IN  THE AIR ALMOST A THOUSAND HOURS A YEAR THIS FELLOW LOVES THIS  BUSINESS LIKE I LOVE BERKSHIRE AND HES A LOT BETTER AT IT THAN I  AM AT BERKSHIRE. YOU CANT FIND PEOPLE LIKE THIS.  YOU  CERTAINLY CANT HIRE THEM.  THE ONE THING I GUARANTEE MARK  IS THAT HES RUNNING THE COMPANY.  PEOPLE LIKE THIS ARE VERY  VERY RARE.  YOU CAN SEE IT IN WHAT HE HAS BUILT AND YOU CAN  SEE IT IN THE PASSION HES GOT FOR WHAT HE IS DOING NOW.   HES NEVER SATISFIED IN TERMS OF GETTING MORE BUSINESS IN THE  AIRFRAME AND THE ENGINES.  HES NEVER SATISFIED IN TERMS OF  GETTING HIS COST TO WHERE THEY SHOULD BE.  HE JUST HAS A  PASSION FOR THE BUSINESS. QUICK:  WARREN WHAT DOES THIS MEAN IN TERMS OF THE  CASH THAT YOU ARE USING FOR THIS?  I KNOW YOU LIKE TO KEEP  ABOUT 20 BILLION DOLLARS IN CASH ON HAND.  ARE YOU STILL IN  THE MARKET FOR OTHER POTENTIAL DEALS? OR DOES THIS TAKE YOU OUT  OF THE MARKET FOR AWHILE? BUFFETT: THIS TAKES US OUT OF THE MARKET FOR AN ELEPHANT  BUT WE WILL PROBABLY BE BUYING A FEW SMALL THINGS IN THE NEXT 6  MONTHS.  WE ARE IN NEGOTIATIONS ON A COUPLE BUT IN TERMS OF  A DEAL OF SIMILAR SIZE IT PRETTY MUCH TAKES US OUT.  WHAT WE  WILL PROBABLY DO ON THIS ONE WE WILL PROBABLY BORROW ABOUT 10  BILLION AND USE ABOUT 23 BILLION OF OUR OWN CASH ON THAT  ORDER.  WELL BE LEFT WITH OVER 40 BILLION PROBABLY IN CASH  WHEN WE GET ALL THROUGH.  BUT I LIKE TO HAVE A LOT OF CASH  AT ALL TIMES SO THIS MEANS WE HAVE TO RELOAD OVER THE NEXT 12  MONTHS OR SO BUT IT DOESNT PRECLUDE DOING SMALLER DEALS BUT WE  WILL BE DOING A FEW PROBABLY. SORKIN: AND WARREN ONE OF THE OTHER QUESTIONS YOU ALWAYS  TALK ABOUT TALENT AND SPECIAL PEOPLE AND SPECIAL BERKSHIRE PEOPLE  AND IT IS HARD TO FIND THEM.  WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT MARK DARE  I ASK THE QUESTION SHOULD WE START TO ADD HIM TO THE LIST OF  POTENTIAL PEOPLE THAT MAY ONLY RUN THIS PARTICULAR COMPANY NOW  BUT MAYBE PUT INTO THE BERKSHIRE FOLD WHEN IT SOMES TO  SUCCESSION? BUFFETT: IF I READ MARK CORRECTLY AND IN THIS RESPECT I AM  SURE I DO ALL HE WANTS TO DO IS RUN PRECISION AND TO TAKE IT TO  GREATER AND GREATER HEIGHTS HE DOES NOT WANT TO RUN  BERKSHIRE  AND TRUE OF MOST OF OUR MANAGERS THEY LOVE WHAT  THEY ARE DOING THATS THE BEAUTY OF IT.  I HAVE TO DECIDE  REALLY WHEN I BUY A COMPANY THERE IS NO WAY IN THE WORLD THAT I  COULD RUN PRECISION OR REALLY ANYBODY IN OUR OPERATION COULD SO  THE FIRST I ASK AND MARKS 58 I ASK IF HE HAS ANY IDEAS AT 65  THAT HES GO AND PLAY SHUFFLE BOARD IN FLORIDA OR SOMETHING LIKE  THAT.  AS LONG AS WE TREAT HIM RIGHT NOW WEVE GOT TO TREAT  PEOPLE RIGHT WE TREAT HIM RIGHT HE WILL BE RUNNING THIS FOR  DECADES AND DECADES. AND THATS WHAT HE WANTS TO DO JUST LIKE I  LIKE RUNNING BERKSHIRE. QUICK: WARREN YOU MENTIONED THAT THIS WILL TAKE YOU OUT OF  THE HUNT FOR A BIG ELEPHANT FOR 12 MONTHS OR SO WHILE THE COMPANY  RELOADS WITH THE CASH  CONTINUALLY COMING IN.  JUST  LAST WEEK BILL ACKMAN MADE IT PUBLIC THAT HE HAS A LARGE STAKE IN  MONDELEZ ONE OF THE THINGS HE THOUGHT ABOUT IS POTENTIALLY  MONDELZ GETTING LUMPED IN WITH KRAFT HEINZ.  DOES THAT MEAN  IT IS NOT AN OPTION AND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF BILLS  PROPOSAL? BUFFETT: WELL I WILL LISTEN TO ANYTHING MY FRIENDS AT 3G  WANT TO DO BUT WITH KRAFT HEINZ WE HAVE OUR WORK CUT OUT FOR US  FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS.  I THINK IT IS QUITE UNLIKELY YOU  NEVER WANT TO SAY ANYTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE BUT I THINK IT IS QUITE  UNLIKELY THAT KRAFT HEINZ WOULD BE DOING A BIG ACQUISITION IN THE  NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS SOMEWHERE DOWN THE ROAD I WOULDNT BE  SURPRISED.  BUT IT ALSO WOULD HAVE TO MAKE SENSE FINANCIALLY  AND FRANKLY MOST OF THE FOOD COMPANIES SELL AT PRICES THAT IT  WOULD BE VERY HARD FOR US TO MAKE A DEAL EVEN IF WE HAD DONE ALL  OF THE WORK NEEDED AT KRAFT HEINZ.  A LOT OF THE COMPANIES  ARE SELLING AT PRICES THAT SORT OF REFLECT IMPROVEMENTS IN THEM  THAT PEOPLE SORT OF WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING AT KRAFT HEINZ AND  BELIEVE ME THIS IS NOT EASY. QUICK: MEANING THAT MONDELEZ AT THESE PRICES YOU WOULDNT  LIKE? BUFFETT: WELL IT WOULD BE HARD FOR US TO MAKE A DEAL THAT  MAKES SENSE YEAH. BUT WHO KNOWS WHAT HAPPENS DOWN THE LINE BUT IF  YOU LOOK AT KELLOGG OR CAMPBELLS SOUP  OR MONDELEZ THEYRE  PRICES TO SOME EXTENT THE MARKET HAS PUT INTO THOSE COMPANIES  PRICES THAT REFLECT AN EXPECTATION KRAFT HEINZ TYPE MARGINS ARE  POSSIBLE AND THAT MAY BE THE CASE BUT I HAVE NOT SEEN IT  ELSEWHERE. SULLIVAN: MR BUFFETT IN 2009 MANY OF THE BANKS CAME TO YOU  FOR HELP. HAVE YOU HAD ANY OIL OR GAS COMPANIES COME TO YOU IN  THE LAST FEW MONTHS LOOKING FOR YOUR HELP, LOOKING FOR YOUR  INVESTMENT? BUFFETT: NOT YET BUT PRICES STAY DOWN HERE.  IF PRICES  STAY DOWN HERE SO FAR I WOULD SAY THAT MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE  OIL AND GAS BUSINESS UP MAYBE UNTIL VERY RECENTLY THEY FELT THAT  OIL PRICES WOULD BOUNCE BACK.  THEY MAY NOT HAVE FELT GAS  PRICES WOULD BOUNCE MUCH BUT THEY FELT OIL PRICES WOULD BOUNCE  BACK.  THE OIL PRODUCTION COMPANIES HAVE BEEN SELLING ON A  BASIS NOT OF $45 WTI THEY HAVE ASSUMED HIGHER PRICES AND OF  COURSE THE FORWARD CURVE HAVE REFLECTED HIGHER PRICES.  I  THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HARD TO MAKE REALISTIC DEALS WITH OIL  AND GAS UP UNTIL NOW BUT WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE  FUTURE.  TO BE SPECIFIC NOBODY HAS COME TO ME. QUICK: DOES THAT MEAN THAT YOU HAVE NOT MADE ANY OTHER  PURCHASES IN THE OIL AND GAS BUSINESS? BUFFETT: THATS CORRECT QUICK: SO THERE IS NOTHING THAT YOUVE SEEN ASIDE FROM THIS  DEAL TODAY THAT YOU THINK HAS BEEN AN OPPORTUNITY YOU WOULD BUY  INTO? BUFFETT: NO OF COURSE THIS IS KIND OF SECENDARY I WOULDNT  SAY MAYBE 15% OF PRECISIONS BUSINESS HAD BEEN IN THERE AND THEY  GOT HURT IN THE LAST COUPLE OF QUARTERS SIGNIFICANTLY BECAUSE  WHEN OIL SLOWS DOWN IF THEYVE GOT VARIOUS BUILDING EQUIPMENT ON  HAND ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY DONT NEED TO ORDER ANY FOR AWHILE EVEN  THOUGH CONTINUE TO PRODUCE.  SO NO WE HAVE NOT MADE ANY  COMMITMENTS IN OIL AND GAS. SORKIN: HEY WARREN EVERY TIME  I SEE YOU I ALWAYS ASK  THE QUESTION IBM, IBM UPDATE THE STOCK IS TRADING I THINK ABOUT  155 DOLLARS RIGHT ABOUT NOW HOW ARE YOU FEELING ABOUT IT BUFFETT: I FEEL FINE. SORKIN: WHATS YOUR BASIS IN THAT COMPANY AT THIS  POINT? BUFFETT: WHATS OUR STOCK COST US? SORKIN: YEH BUFFETT: I WOULD SAY AROUND 170 SORKIN: AROUND 17O NOW BY MY MATH YOU HAVE ACTUALLY MADE  THE MONEY STILL ON THIS DEAL ON PART I THINK THE FUNCTION OF THE  DIVIDENDS BUT YOU ARE NOT CONCERNED AT ALL IN TERMS OF THE  STOCK BUFFETT: I LOVE IT WHEN IT GOES DOWN IT MEANS THE COMPANY  BUYS STOCK CHEAPER AND MEANS IF I WANT TO BUY MORE STOCK YOU CAN  LOOK AT OUR 13F IN A FEW DAYS IT MEANS I GET TO BUY IT  CHEAPER QUICK: DOES THAT MEAN YOUVE BEEN BUYING IT? BUFFETT: I AM NOT A SELLER OF STOCK.  PEOPLE ASSUME  WHEN WE BUY SOME STOCK WE WANT IT TO GO UP.  WE DONT WANT  IT TO GO UP MAYBE OBVIOUSLY EVENTUALLY MAYBE FIVE OR TEN YEARS  FROM NOW BUT WE LOVE THE IDEA OF A COMPANY BUYING ITS STOCK  CHEAPER. I MEAN THATS HAPPENED AT AMERICAN EXPRESS FOR INSTANCE  AMERICAN EXPRESS IS A REGULAR REPURCHASER OF SHARES AND WE OWN  15% OF IT AND OWNERSHIP GOES UP FASTER IF THE STOCK IS DOWN THAN  IF THE STOCK IS UP.  SULLIVAN: WE HAD ON FRIDAY A BILLION DOLLAR ACTIVIST  INVESTMENT IN AMERICAN EXPRESS MR BUFFETT JEFFREY UBEN OF  VALUEACT CAPITAL.  WHEN YOU OWN A STOCK LIKE AN AMERICAN  EXPRESS ARE YOU HAPPY TO SEE AN ACTIVIST COME IN DO YOU WELCOME  IT. BUFFETT: NO NOT PARTICULARLY BUT IT IS UP TO THEM WHAT THEY  DO WITH THEIR MONEY.  ACTUALLY IT SENDS UP FOUR OR FIVE  POINTS SO THE EXTENT THAT AMERICAN EXPRESS IS REPURCHASING SHARES  WE CANT BUY STOCKS IN AMERICAN EXPRESS BECAUSE IT IS A  BANKHOLDING COMPANY AND WE OWN OVER 10% BUT THE CHEAPER THE STOCK  IS THE MORE SHARES AMERICAN EXPRESS WILL BE ABLE TO REPURCHASE  FOR A GIVEN AMOUNT OF MONEY AND ON BALANCE THAT HELPS US WERE  BUYING YOU KNOW THERE IS NO MORAL PROBLEM ATTACHED TO IT BECAUSE  IT TAKES PLACE IN THE MARKET BUT WERE ON OUR PARTNERS  CHEAPER. QUICK: LETS TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE THAT IS ALSO A LOT  CHEAPER THAN IT WAS A WEEK AGO YOU LOOKS AT THE MEDIA STOCKS  DISNEY KICKED IT OFF WHEN BOB IGER SAID THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT  ESPN, VERY BRIEF CONCERNS FROM HIS PERSPECTIVE THE MARKET TOOK  THAT AS A HUGE SELLING POINT NOT ONLY FOR DISNEY BUT ALL OF THE  MEDIA RELATED STOCKS DO YOU SEE ANYTHING IN THE MEDIA INDUSTRY  YOU LIKE AT THESE PRICES? BUFFETT: NO I WOULD SAY THAT I CONSIDER BOB IGER AND I KNOW  HIM WELL AND HAD EXPERIENCE WITH HIM MORE THAN 20 YEARS AGO I  THINK HE IS ONE OF THE GREAT MANAGERS IN AMERICA AND A GOOD GUY  BEYOND THAT BUT IM AN OBSERVER OF THE MEDIA PICTURE TODD AND  TEDD OWN SOME SHARES IN CERTAIN MEDIA STOCKS BUT I AM NO VICTIM  OF THIS MYSELF AND THE SELL OFF DID NOT ENTICE ME. SORKIN: HEY WARREN SPEAKING OF BUYBACKS ONE OF THE  QUESTIONS AND I DONT THINK WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS SINCE YOU  SENT YOUR LETTER AND WE HAD YOU ON THE SHOW BUT LARRY FINK FROM  BLACKROCK SENT A LETTER A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO TO CEOS AROUND THE  COUNTRY AND SAID LOOK STOP WITH THE BUYBACKS, STOP WITH THE  DIVIDENDS WE WANT YOU INVESTING IN THE FUTURE AND IN PART I WOULD  ARGUE THAT LETTER SEEMED TO INSPIRE HILLARY CLINTON WITH HER  LATEST QUARTERLY CAPITALISM APPROACH AND PROGRAM THAT SHES TALK  ABOUT IN TERMS OF CHANGING THE TAX STRUCTURE CAPITAL GAINS  STRUCTURE AROUND INVESTMENTS.  WHAT DO YOU THINK OF WHAT  HILLARY CLINTON HAD TO SAY AND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF WHAT LARRY  FINK HAD TO SAY? BUFFETT: WELL PEOPLE MAKE BUYBACKS VERY COMPLICATED.    BUYBACKS MAKE SENSE WHEN YOU ARE BUYING YOUR STOCK BACK  BELOW ITS INTRINSIC VALUE AND WHEN YOU DONT NEED THAT MONEY FOR  THE NEEDS OF THE BUSINESS.  IT MAKES NO SENSE WHEN YOU PAY  ABOVE INTRINSIC VALUE AND THATS A VERY SIMPLE PRINCIPAL BUT IT  HAS BEEN IGNORED BY MANY MANAGEMENTS OVER TIME.  IF YOU LOOK  AT THE HISTORY OF BUYBACKS PEOPLE BUYBACK A LOT IN TERMS OF  AGRIGATE BUYBACKS PEOPLE BUY A LOT MORE STOCK BACK WHEN STOCKS  ARE UP THAN WHEN THEY ARE DOWN BUT IN THAT WAY THEY ARE SORT OF  BEHAVING LIKE JOE PUBLIC YOU KNOW.  THERE HAVE BEEN SOME  GREAT INVESTMENT STORIES BASED ON PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT BACK STOCK  INTELLIGENTLY WHICH MEANS BUYING IT AT A DISCOUNT FROM ITS  INTRINSIC VALUE.  WE WOULD BUY BACK STOCK BY THE BUSHELL  BASKETS IF IT SOLD WELL BELOW INTRINSIC VALUE IT WOULD HAVE TO BE  WELL BELOW INTRINSIC VALUE AND WE WONT BUY A SHARE IF WE   THINK WE ARE PAYING INTRINSIC VALUE OR MORE. IT IS NOT A  COMPLICATED EQUATION BUT MANAGEMENTS WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS THEY ARE  GOING TO HAVEA 5 BILLION DOLLAR BUYBACK THEY OUGHT TO SAY WE ARE  HAVING A 5 BILLION DOLLAR BUYBACK IF WE CAN BUY IT AT X OR BELOW  BUT THATS JUST NOT THE WAY IT OPERATES. SULLIVAN:  HAS IT BEEN AN EFFICIENT USE OF  CAPITAL BUFFETT: IT HAS BEEN A TERRIFICLY EFFICIENT USE OF CAPITAL  FOR SOME COMPANIES AND BEEN A VERY STUPID USE OF CAPITAL FOR  OTHER COMPANIES.  I WOULD ARGUE THAT OUR BUYBACKS HAVE BEEN  PEANUTS UNFORTUNATELY  BUT OUR COUPLE OF BUYBACKS MADE GREAT  SENSE.  BUT WE COULDNT DO IT ON SCALE.  SORKIN: AND WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF HILLARY CLINTONS PROPOSAL  ON CAPITAL GAINS BUT SHE ALSO SAID I BELIEVE THAT SHE WANTS  PEOPLE TO LOOK INTO BUYBACKS THEMSELVES IN TERMS OF HOW THEY  SHOULD BE REGULATED.  ELIZABETH WARREN  AND OTHERS HAVE  SUGGESTED THEY ARE EFFECTIVELY INSIDER TRADING BECAUSE THE  COMPANIES KNOW ABOUT IT. BUFFETT: WELL I WILL BE GLAD TO WRITE A PAPER ON IT  SOMETIME.  I HAVE WRITTEN ON IT ABOUT 20 TIMES OVER THE  YEARS AND IN GENERAL VERY MUCH APPROVE OF WHERE HILLARY IS GOING  IN TERMS OF FINE TUNING ALL THE POINTS WELL TALK ABOUT THAT AS  THE CAMPAIGN PROGRESSES.  BUT BUYBACKS ARE NOT NIRVANA AND  THEY ARE NOT EVIL IT IS JUST A QUESTION OR WHETHER THEY MAKE  SENSE AND IF OUR STOCK SELLS WELL BELOW INTRINSIC VALUE AND WE  HAVE MONEY WE DONT NEED FOR THE BUSINESS WE WILL BUY IT BACK  JUST AS FAST AS WE CAN NOW UNFORTUNATELY WHENEVER I SAY THAT IT  KEEPS IT FROM HAPPENING. QUICK: WARREN WE KNOW THAT YOU ARE A SUPPORTER OF HILLARY  CLINTON BUT DID YOU WATCH THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL DEBATES THAT  TOOK PLACE LAST WEEK? BUFFETT: I WOULDNT HAVE MISSED IT QUICK: AND WHAT DID YOU THINK? BUFFETT: I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS TERRIFIC TELEVISION AND I  THINK THERES A SMALL CHANCE WITH PROPORTIONAL AWARDING DELEGATES  IN A GREAT MANY OF THE PRIMARIES AND WITH SUPER PACKS ENABLING  PEOPLE TO KEEP GETTING FINANCE WHERE AS OTHERWISE THEY WOULD DROP  OUT FOR LACK OF MONEY IF THEY WERENT DOING THAT WELL.  I  THINK THERE IS ACTUALLY SOME CHANCE THAT WHEN THEY GO TO THE  REPUBLICAN CONVENTION NO ONE WILL HAVE A MAJORITY GOING IN BUT I  THINK IT WILL BE VERY VERY INTERESTING.  DONALD TRUMP IS  GOING TO HAVE A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF DELEGATES AND SO WILL A  WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHERS AND IN THE PAST UNLESS YOU WERE IN THE TOP  2 OR 3 YOUR FUNDING DRIES UP AND YOU GET TO A COUPLE OF STATES  AND THAT WAS WITH BUT WITH SUPER PACKS AROUND YOU CAN HAVE QUITE  A FEW CANDIDATES IN IT FOR QUITE A BIT OF TIME AND THE PIE COULD  GET DIVIDED IN SUCH A WAY THAT NOBODY HAS A MAJORITY.  IT IS  GOING TO BE VERY INTERESTING.  IT IS A GREAT SPECTATOR  SPORT. QUICK: WE DID HAVE AN OVERNIGHT POLL AN NBC NEWS POLL THAT  WAS CONDUCTED FROM FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY IT SHOWED THAT DONALD  TRUMP IS STILL LEADING THE PACK WHICH MIGHT COME AS A SURPRISE TO  SOME PUNDITS WHO HAD KIND OF WRITTEN HIM OFF AFTER THAT  PERFORMANCE. BUFFETT: YEH NO HE IF YOU CAN GET BY THE JOHN MCCAIN IS NOT  A HERO AND A FEW THINGS AND NOT HAVE YOUR NUMBERS GO DOWN YOU  HAVE A VERY SOLID BASE AND YOU KNOW I WOULDNT BE SURPRISED IF HE  MAINTAINS QUITE A SOLID BASE FOR A LONG TIME. AND THAT MEANS HE  IS GOING TO GET A FAIR NUMBER OF DELEGATES IF YOU GET IT IN  PROPORTIONAL STATES. AND HE IS NOT GOING TO RUN OUT OF MONEY SO  IT IS GOING TO BE A LOT OF FUN TO WATCH PARTICULARLY IF YOU ARE A  DEMOCRAT.  QUICK: I WAS GOING TO SAY AS A DEMOCRAT YOU MUST ENJOY HOW  THIS PLAYS OUT.  WHO WOULD YOU MOST LIKE TO SEE YOUR  CANDIDATE RUN AGAINST? BUFFETT: WELL I THINK IF I GAVE THAT PREDICTION IT WOULD BE  SORT OF THE KISS OF DEATH ON THAT CANDIDATE.  I WANT TO SEE  HER RUN AGAINST THE WHOLE FIELD.  QUICK: YOU KNOW WARREN WE HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER  THINGS WE WOULD LOVE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WE SAW THE JOBS NUMBER  THAT CAME IN.  THE JOBS REPORT WAS JUST AS EXPECTED ON  FRIDAY 215,000 A LOT OF PEOPLE SPECULATING THAT THE FED WILL  RAISE INTEREST RATES COME SEPTEMBER.  YOU HAVE A VERY GOOD  IDEA OF WHATS HAPPENING IN THE ECONOMY JUST BASED ON THE NUMBERS  THAT YOU SEE AND THE BUSINESSES THAT YOU HAVE YOUR FINGER ON THE  PULSE.  WHAT DO YOU THINK IS HAPPENING IN THE ECONOMY.   WHAT DO YOU THINK THE FED SHOULD DO IN SPETEMBER? BUFFETT: I THINK WHATS HAPPENING WITH THE ECONOMY IS  EXACTLY WHATS BEEN HAPPENING NOW FOR FIVE YEARS IS THAT IT IS  MOVING AHEAD ROUGHLY AT 2% RATE AND IN CERTAIN INDUSTRIES A SPURT  OCCASSIONALLY AUTOS ARE STRONG RIGHT NOW BUT IT HAS BEEN A VERY  STEADY INCREASE AND PEOPLE HAVE TALKED ABOUT DOUBLE DIPS AND  THEYVE TALKED ABOUT ACCELERATION AND EVERY TIME THEY TALK ABOUT  IT MOVING SHARPLY IN ONE DIRECTION IT DOESNT DO IT.   THE  ECONOMY HAS COME BACK AND IT HAS COME BACK VERY WELL  CONSIDERING THE KIND OF SHOCK THAT WE HAD 5 OR 6 YEARS AGO BUT I  DONT SEE IT PARTICULARLY ACCELERATING AND I DONT SEE IT  DECELERATING EITHER.  I HAVE SAID BEFORE I THINK IT IS VERY  TOUGH TO PUSH RATES HIGHER IN THE U.S. WHEN EUROPE NEEDS TO KEEP  THEM ALL AND YOUVE GOT THE SITUATION EXISTING AROUND THE WORLD  BUT I KEEP HEARING THE VARIOUS GOVERNORS SAY IT IS GOING TO  HAPPEN SOON SO BUT I DONT THINK IT IS AN EASY DECISION WHEN  RATES ARE CONSIDERABLY LOWER IN EUROPE AND YOU MAY BE AFFECTING  EXPORTS AND IMPORTS VERY SIGNIFICANTLY IF YOU PUSH RATES HERE TO  BE CONSIDERABLY HIGHER THAN THEY EXIST IN EUROPE. QUICK: THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN  CONCERNED ABOUT THE MARKET LATELY IF YOU HAVE WATCHED WHAT HAS  BEEN HAPPENING DURING EARNINGS SEASON SOME OF THE MOVES HAVE BEEN  EXTRAORDINARY TO SEE PEOPLE MISSING BY SMALL AMOUNTS ON EARNINGS  OR REVENUE LINES AND THEN COMING IN WITH DOUBLE DIGIT STOCK  DECLINES YOU ALSO SAW WHAT HAPPENED WITH MEDIA STOCKS OVERALL  MOVE THE ENTIRE SECTOR LOWER THAT HAS SOME PEOPLE THINKING THAT  THERE IS A LOT OF WEAKNESS IN THE MARKET AND THAT THERE IS  SOMETHING OF A CORRECTION THATS DUE.  I AM GUESSING THAT I  WOULDNT PUT YOU IN THAT CAMP IF YOU ARE WILLING TO DO DEALS LIKE  THIS OR DO YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING ON A DAY TO DAY  BASIS? BUFFETT: STOCKS ARE GOING TO BE HIGHER AND PERHAPS A LOT  HIGHER 10 YEARS FROM NOW, 20 YEARS FROM NOW I AM NOT SMART ENOUGH  TO PICK TIMES TO GET IN AND GET OUT IF YOU ARE IN SOMETHING THAT  IS GOING TO BE A LOT HIGHER OVER TIME.  IF YOU THOUGHT YOUR  HOUSE WAS GOING TO GO DOWN 5% IN PRICE YOU WOULDNT SELL YOUR  HOUSE AND HOPE TO BUY IT BACK 5% CHEAPER.  THATS NOT MY  GAME.  MY GAME IS TO OWN DECENT BUSINESSES AND OWN THEM AT  DECENT PRICES AND YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY OVER TIME  IF YOU DO IT BUT I THINK THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO DANCE IN AND  OUT OF MARKETS IS QUITE LIMITED AND IN MY CASE IT IS  ZERO.  QUICK:  WARREN THERE IS A STORY ON THE FRONT PAGE OF  THE NEW YORK TIMES TODAY ABOUT COCA COLA WHICH IS A COMPANY THAT  YOU ALSO THE LARGEST SHAREHOLDER IN IT POINTS OUT THAT COCA COLA  HAS TEAMED UP WITH SOME INFLUENTIAL SCIENTISTS TO TRY AND ADVANCE  A MESSAGE IN MEDICAL JOURNALS  THAT IT IS REALLY MORE ABOUT  HOW MUCH YOU EXERCISE NOT WHAT YOU EAT THAT MATTERS.  THE  TIMES ACTUALLY KIND OF PUTS THIS AS SOMETHING WHERE THEY LOOK   ASKANCE THE IDEA THAT BIG COPORATION IS FUNDING A MESSAGE  LIKE THIS WHAT DO YOU SAY AS THE LARGEST SHAREHOLDER? BUFFETT:  WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR WEIGHT DEPENDS ON HOW  MUCH YOU TAKE IN AND HOW MUCH YOU BURN UP.  AND IF YOU TAKE  IN 2700 CALORIES AND YOU BURN UP 2700 YOUR WEIGHT ISNT GOING TO  CHANGE AND IF YOU TAKE IN 3500 AND BURN 2500 YOU ARE GOING TO  GAIN WEIGHT.  ITS A MATHEMATICAL TYPE EQUATION AND IF YOU  ARE LIKE ME AND DONT LIKE TO EXERCISE MUCH THAN YOU BETTER NOT  TAKE IN TOO MUCH.  THERE IS NO MYSTERY TO WEIGHT.   CALORIES ARE DEFINED THERES 4 PER GRAM IF YOU ARE DEALING WITH  PROTEIN AND CARBOHYDRATES THERES 9 PER GRAM WITH FAT AND YOUVE  GOT TO FIGURE IT OUT IF YOU WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT SO YOUR BODY  BURNS OFF AS MANY AS YOU ARE CONSUMING.

Trumps options on emergency funding for the border range from#As the White House descends further into chaos, no one can discern President Donald Trumps next move until he makes it.But Trump and administration aides have signaled that he views a presidential declaration of emergency as an exit ramp from the standoff with Congress that has shut down a large chunk of the government for 18 days now. It would, simultaneously, let him assent to reopening federal agencies and assert unilateral authority to order construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.Bracing for Trumps decision, congressional aides in both parties say the potential scope of presidential action ranges from very big to very small.A presidents authority to declare a national emergency gives him the power to redirect taxpayer funds Congress has already approved. In conversations with lawmakers, the White House has pointed toward two different pots of Pentagon money. One, containing less than $1 billion, is for curtailing drug shipments. The other, containing $22 billion, is for military construction projects.The military construction pot might even be enough to pay for whatever barrier Trump wants across the 2,000-mile border, whether constructed of concrete or steel or something else. If Trump goes big, he could announce his intention to do exactly that.Yet the bigger he goes, the bigger the backlash he risks.An emergency declaration related to border control would face immediate legal challenges, just as his attempt to ban travel into the United States from some majority-Muslim countries did. The more miles of wall Trump attempts to build under an emergency declaration, the more potential challengers — Congress, private landowners, affected local governments.Moreover, a recent 17-page report to Congress shows that the pot of military construction money contains funds previously designated for projects across the country. That would ensure resistance from both red and blue states eager for those projects. And at a time when Trump speaks openly about the prospect of impeachment proceedings, the weak factual basis for a border emergency claim would invite House Democrats to assert an unconstitutional abuse of executive power.But a little-noticed administration maneuver last fall points to a far more limited possibility.It could be completed by only touching the small pot of anti-drug money. It wouldnt require diverting cash from military construction projects elsewhere. It would only affect 31 miles of the Mexican border on a federal explosives-testing site in Arizona.Last fall, the Pentagon informed Congress that the Navy had committed $7.5 million to advance planning and survey efforts for new and improved border barriers on the Barry M. Goldwater Range. Calling the range a known drug-smuggling corridor, Assistant Defense Secretary Kenneth Rapuano wrote that such barriers will both protect BMGR from such illegal activity and address human life and safety concerns by deterring unlawful entry onto an active bombing range.In an October letter to Democratic Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, who now chairs the House Armed Services Committee, Rapuano said no construction had occurred on the range. But he noted that the administration was reviewing its authority and funding options.Expressing strong opposition, Smith and his Democratic colleagues estimated that the 31 miles worth of barrier along the range would cost $450 million. The anti-drug account that the Pentagon might try to tap contains $760 million, according to a Republican congressional aide.Trump has the opportunity to clarify his intentions in a televised prime-time address on the issue Tuesday. If recent form holds, lawmakers will find out at the same time everyone else does.
Acting IMF chief says global economy is fragile, urging US#Acting IMF Managing Director David Lipton, in a veiled appeal Thursday on CNBC, called on the U.S. and China to come to an agreement and end their yearlong trade war.Lipton told Squawk on the Street that the global economic slowdown has been certainly affected by the trade tensions, though he did not mention the U.S. or China by name.The latest round of trade talks between the worlds two biggest economies on Tuesday and Wednesday in Shanghai made little progress. Negotiations are set to resume in September in Washington.Tensions between the White House and Chinese technology giants may also be contributing to the global economic slowdown, Lipton said.Its time for the countries to have dialogue, to reach agreements, to try to find a way through this, since the global economy is fragile, he said.Global trade has been lower in the first six months of this year compared with the same period in 2018, Lipton said, adding that its a time for vigilance.Global trade is actually contracting, and that is not a good situation, he warned.Lipton said that if a global recession were to start, central banks, including the Federal Reserve, would be in weakened positions to fight it because of all the easy monetary policies.Case in point, the Fed lowered interest rates by 0.25% on Wednesday.Lipton moved into the acting director role after Christine Lagarde resigned as head of the International Monetary Fund. Largarde has been nominated to be the next president of the European Central Bank.

All-time record options bets on volatility spook Wall Street over#Options experts are saying Thursdays record volume in volatility derivatives bets may signal a dangerous problem with the size of volatility-linked trading products.The focus is on the CBOE volatility index, a key measure of market expectations for near-term volatility as conveyed by the price of S&P 500 index options. The CBOE announced VIX options volume hit 2.56 million contracts on Thursday, a record for a single day. In addition, VIX futures volume reached 939,000 contracts, another record.The high volume coincided with a 44 percent spike in the VIX, to 16.04, its highest daily close for the year. The VIX recently hit a record intraday low of 8.84. On Friday afternoon, it was at 14.54.The volume in VIX options and futures tells us that yesterday was potentially a more serious event, and validates some of what we have discussed in recent notes about the growing leverage in VIX-linked products, Macro Risk Advisors head derivatives strategist Pravit Chintawongvanich wrote in a note to clients Friday.
Feds Lockhart: US Economy Still Faces Serious Risks#It is too soon to declare turmoil in financial markets over and while the U.S. economy should gradually recover, this outlook faces big risks, a top Federal Reserve policy-maker said Monday. Although conditions have improved on some fronts, I dont feel we can yet breathe easy. The path of the economy is still enveloped in considerable uncertainty, and serious risks remain, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Dennis Lockhart said in prepared remarks. A copy of his speech to a luncheon event for the Jacksonville Chamber of Commerce was made available to the media prior to delivery. Lockhart is not a voting member of the Feds interest-rate setting committee this year. The Fed has slashed interest rates by 3.25 percentage points since last September to shield the economy from a global credit crunch. That squeeze was sparked by a U.S. housing crisis that has chilled growth and threatened to tip the economy into recession. But Lockhart signaled he was optimistic that the country would escape this fate. On balance, Im expecting a weak first half followed by some improvement in the second half as the drags on growth I mentioned earlier gradually diminish, he said. But Lockhart also stressed that he was still concerned by the threat of renewed financial instability undermining growth. We remain in a period of considerable uncertainty. There are very real risks to this outlook, he said. He said an oil price shock, further upsets in financial markets and a more severe-than-expected downturn in housing could all upset his forecast for U.S. growth to pick up somewhat in the second half of 2008. Lockhart also said inflation was elevated with hints of rising inflation expectations, but said it should abate as energy and food prices moderate and a softer economy limits the ability of firms to pass on higher prices to customers. My base case for inflation assumes a fall-off from the current elevated level of inflation supported by some moderation of energy and food price increases, Lockhart said. I also expect soft economic growth to constrain the ability of businesses to pass through energy and other costs and raise prices in the coming months, he added.

Ping An Not Concerned about Pru-AIG deal#Ping An Insurance, Chinas No. 2 insurer, said on Friday it was not concerned about a plan by Britains Prudential to buy the Asia assets of U.S. insurer AIG, the market leader among foreign insurers in China.Ping An does not believe Prudentials acquisition of AIGs Asia unit, AIA, would change Chinas insurance landscape, said Chairman Ma Mingzhe, speaking on the sidelines of the opening of the National Peoples Congress in Beijing. I believe domestic insurers are very competitive in China and we know our market very well, said Ma of Ping An, partly owned by HSBC Holdings Plc I think foreign insurers will still have much to learn in China, he added.In what is the insurance industrys biggest acquisition, Prudential is buying American International Assurance in a big bet on soaring demand in Asia for personal financial services. AIA is regarded as AIGs crown jewel because of its size, cash generation and presence in fast-growth Asia.Ma said Ping An was not interested in teaming with Prudential for the bid, amid some market expectations that Prudential may seek partners such as Asian sovereign funds and cash-rich large Chinese enterprises to help in its $35.5 billion acquisition plan due to the deals size.Mas commments were in line with his counterpart Yang Chao, chairman of Ping Ans bigger rival China Life who said the countrys No.1 insurer was not considering involvement in the Prudential-AIG deal.Purely from the financial perspective, I think we can afford to do deals like that, but we are not considering it and Prudential didnt talk to us either, Yang told reporters in Beijing.China Life was in talks to invest in AIA last year or to subscribe part of AIAs originally planned initial public offering of shares in Hong Kong but the talks failed to move forward, Chinese media reported.China LegacyPing Ans Ma, whose firm made huge losses from a wrong bet on its investments in Europes Fortis amid the financial crisis, said he believed that domestic firms would continue to dominate Chinas insurance market for at least the next five to 10 years.While AIG can trace its Asian roots back to 1919, when Cornelius Vander Starr started a small insurance agency in Shanghai, AIA started in China in 1992. AIA in China is 100 percent owned by AIG -- the only wholly-foreign owned insurer with special permission from Beijing to operate in the country.Other foreign insurers have long complained to Beijing about AIAs exclusive ownership status as they seek a bigger share of the countrys fast-expanding insurance business.Prudential currently operates CITIC-Prudential Insurance Co in China, a 50-50 joint venture in China with CITIC Group, Chinas biggest financial conglomerate.When asked for comments on the future of AIAs ownership status in China, Ma replied: I think this will be a problem for Prudential to deal with.Ma also noted Ping An would not be interested in AIAs China assets even if they were put up for sale.AIA collected 8 billion yuan ($1.17 billion) in premiums in 2009, accounting for 18.9 percent market share among Sino-foreign joint-venture life insurers in China, or nearly 1 percent of total market share, according to official data.Chinas top three insurers -- China Life, Ping An and China Pacific Insurance partly owned by the Carlyle Group -- currently control a combined over 50 percent share of Chinas life insurance market.
Romney seeks more assertive US policy on China#WASHINGTON -- Republican presidential contender Mitt Romney is promising to get tough on China to help American workers, but his plans could backfire.Romney is pledging, on his first day in office, to designate China a currency manipulator, a step no administration has taken against any country for 18 years.That could, eventually, lead to tariffs punishing China for policies that Americans believe unfairly keep Chinese products cheap, hurting U.S. manufacturers. Tariffs could trigger a trade war with a country that is the fastest-growing market for U.S. exports. Even if they dont, the designation would instantly set back relations with Asias emerging superpower.The U.S. seeks Chinese cooperation on international hot spots, such as North Korea and Iran, and wants to narrow differences over how to handle maritime territorial disputes in East Asia.Given the potential repercussions, some foreign policy experts doubt Romney would carry out the currency threat. Other presidential candidates have made similar promises in order to appeal to voters who have seen manufacturing jobs migrate to China. But, once elected, they soften their approach.Theres probably been wisdom in administrations in the past, Republican and Democrat, of not wanting to go there, said Jon Huntsman, who served as President Barack Obamas first ambassador to China before a failed bid for the Republican presidential nomination.But the commitment to act on Inauguration Day doesnt appear to leave much room to back down.Romney has also taken aim at Obamas pivot to Asia _ a strategy of deploying more forces and shoring up U.S. alliances there, in part to counter Chinas military buildup.In a speech this week, Romney said Chinas recent assertiveness was sending chills through the region. He said the pivot is under-resourced and has alienated U.S. allies elsewhere. He outlined plans to expand U.S. naval power _ although its unclear how hed pay for it since he also wants to slash government spending.What we have seen from the Obama administration has been acquiescence to China, not just on trade issues and currency issues, but on issues of security and human rights, said Romney foreign policy adviser Alex Wong. To protect our interests and those of our small businesses and of our economy, we have to take measures to make sure China does play by the rules.U.S.-Chinese relations are entering a critical juncture. Two days after the Nov. 6 vote, China will begin its own once-in-a-decade leadership transition. How the next U.S. administration gets on with the new guard in Beijing could determine whether the worlds pre-eminent military powers can cooperate in the Asia-Pacific region or head on a path to confrontation.Appreciation of those stakes tends to get lost in the fiercely fought election campaign.Both Romney and Obama have TV spots with China as a foil. Romney accuses Obama of being soft on Chinas trade practices; Obama accuses Romney of outsourcing U.S. jobs to China when he ran the private equity firm Bain Capital.The tone of the debate, labeling China a cheat, has drawn withering criticism from the architect of U.S. re-engagement with Beijing 40 years ago, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who has nonetheless endorsed Romney. Kissinger said that avoiding conflict between the powers is the most fundamental challenge for U.S. foreign policy.Chinas state media has weighed in with unusually direct criticism of a presidential candidate, suggesting that Beijing hopes Obama will win.News agency Xinhua has accused Romney of hypocrisy, saying much of his wealth was made doing business with Chinese companies and warning that his mudslinging policies could spark a trade war.Early in his presidency, Obama made warmer relations with China a priority, and ties have deepened. The two governments have navigated some rough patches _ such as the standoff over a blind activist, Chen Guangcheng, who sought refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and was then allowed to come to the U.S. to study. The Obama administration said that reflected a maturing relationship.But diplomacy has failed to bridge fundamental differences on issues such as climate change, the civil war in Syria and Chinas territorial disputes with its neighbors. And as the U.S. has wound down its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, its modest moves to deploy more forces around Asia have irritated Beijing.Romney is calling for an even stronger U.S. presence in the Pacific. Wong said that would encourage the peaceful resolution of the regions many maritime territorial disputes, including one flaring between U.S. ally Japan and China over islands both claim. He said Romney would make clear it has a treaty alliance with Japan that covers the islands and has the naval power to back it up.Those plans, though, could take years to implement. Addressing the currency issue on Day One would immediately affect relations.Romney says he would designate China as a manipulator unless it stops currency manipulation by his January inauguration. Romney trade policy adviser Oren Cass said this would set a new tone and show the U.S. is willing to take China to task over a range of trade violations, including intellectual property theft and restrictions on market access for U.S. companies in China.The designation itself would not mandate any sanctions, but would require that the U.S. hold consultations with China.Cass said that if Beijing doesnt move toward changing its currency policies after consultations, the U.S. could impose so-called countervailing duties on Chinese products.But Matthew Goodman, former director of international economics in the National Security Council under Obama, said the U.S. discretion to unilaterally impose retaliatory tariffs ended when it joined the World Trade Organization in 1995, and in practice it is difficult to take a currency dispute to the WTO for settlement. Cass says that under domestic law, the U.S. could impose countervailing duties, and its an open legal question at the WTO whether member states can do so unilaterally to compensate for a currency subsidy.How China would respond may be swayed by its leadership transition. The new guard would not want to appear weak. But neither would China want the dispute to escalate as it relies on exports and faces its own economic slowdown. If that translates into major job losses at home it could affect social stability, which is Beijings biggest concern.Obama has consistently opted against designation of China as a currency manipulator. Like President George W. Bush before him, he has preferred to wait while economic forces encourage Beijing to allow its currency to strengthen _ which it has done, although most economists still believe it is undervalued.The Treasury is due to make its next six-month assessment on Monday, although its not yet clear if it will be announced on that date. China is likely to get a pass.
Lululemons product chief to leave in organizational shuffle#Lululemon Athletica said on Wednesday that its chief product  officer is leaving after just two years with the premium yogawear  retailer, which has struggled in recent months with narrowing  margins and supply-chain hiccups.Tara Poseley, a former Kmart executive who was hired by Lululemon  in October 2013, will leave after a transition period and her  role will be eliminated, the Vancouver-based company said.Poseley replaced Sheree Waterson, who departed earlier that year  amid a backlash over the high profile recall of overly sheer yoga  pants and concerns about product quality.

Whether at home or abroad, politicians don’t really need me to identify new problems – they have enough of those. But where can I match my passion for a cause with some constructive ideas? I think it’s worth talking about. Here’s the problem.Both the US and UK economies rely too heavily on selling services. Financial services in particular, as the last two years have shown very dramatically. We all know that many products can be made cheaper and faster overseas. But now the large manufacturers such as China, India and South Korea are moving up the value chain.
Grubhub CEO says Trump email misconstrued#Grubhub CEO Matt Maloney says his comments were misconstrued in  an email Wednesday in which he strongly objected to  President-elect Donald Trumps incendiary policies.  I did not ask anyone to resign if they voted for Trump, he said  in a blog post late Thursday. To the contrary, the message of  the email is that we do not tolerate discriminatory activity or  hateful commentary in the workplace, and that we will stand up  for our employees.  Some workers at the online food-delivery company said they were  left with the impression they werent welcome if they supported  Trump.  In an email to the companys more than 1,000 employees on  Wednesday, obtained by BuzzFeed News, Maloney said:  I absolutely reject the nationalist, anti-immigrant and hateful  politics of Donald Trump and will work to shield our community  from this movement as best as I can. As we all try to understand  what this vote means to us, I want to affirm to anyone on our  team that is scared or feels personally exposed, that I (and)  everyone else here at Grubhub will fight for your dignity and  your right to make a better life for yourself and your family  here in the United States.  Peter Thiel to join Trump transition team, report  says Americans really did crash the Canadian  immigration site on Election DayJeff Bezos, who once joked about sending Trump to space, changes  tune  If you do not agree with this statement then please reply to  this email with your resignation because you have no place here.  We do not tolerate hateful attitudes on our team.  Maloney, a supporter of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary  Clinton, spared no words in his email Wednesday. He said Trumps  words and actions would have earned him an immediate  termination at the Chicago-based start-up, valued at more than  $3 billion.  While demeaning, insulting, and ridiculing minorities,  immigrants, and the physically/mentally disabled worked for Mr.  Trump, I want to be clear that this behavior — and these  views — have no place at Grubhub, Maloney said in the email  Wednesday.
Euro zone business activity nears 3-year peak#A nascent recovery in euro zone business activity continued on  Wednesday with data managing to beat analysts expectations,  despite slower growth in France and fears of falling prices  weighing on sentiment.  Markits flash purchasing managers index (PMI) for April  revealed that the euro zones composite index rose to 54.0, up  from 53.1 in March. A reading above 50 marks an expansion in the  private sector.  The data was driven by strong growth in Germany, with the  composite number rising to 56.3 in April, from 54.3 in March.  France saw slower growth in its private sector, but output rose  for a second month with a figure of 50.5, down from Marchs 51.8  reading. Output in the euro zones second-largest economy was hit  by new orders in manufacturing, which stagnated after rising in  March. This caused French firms to once again cut back on their  staffing levels, according to Markit, the London-based research  company that collates the data.  The data provided proof that French growth was still fragile, according to Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight. This was in marked contrast to the robust expansion he suggested the German numbers indicated. Markit Tweet  The single currency rose to a session high of $1.3843 shortly  after the data release. The euro had started the session at $1.3806. European stock markets showed little change with earnings  release in the tech sector continuing to weigh on investor  sentiment.  Despite the softer data from France, the private sector in the  euro area grew at its fastest in just under three years in April,  with the bloc as a whole showing signs of a return to job  creation.  With backlogs of work rising, albeit only modestly, firms took  on more staff in order to expand capacity. The increase in  employment was the largest since September 2011, and only the  second since 2011. Rates of job creation in both the  manufacturing and service sectors were nevertheless only modest  as many firms continued to focus on keeping costs low to boost  competitiveness, the company said in Wednesdays release.

Australia headed into perfect storm in 2015#Australias economy will undergo a crucial stress test in 2015,  faced with a triple whammy from the lagged impact of plunging  commodity prices, sharp declines in mining investment and renewed  fiscal tightening, says Goldman Sachs.  The challenges are now widely known…but these challenges  still lie mainly ahead for Australia rather than behind, Tim  Toohey, chief economist, Australia at Goldman Sachs wrote in a  note on Wednesday.  On top of the these headwinds, the economy  also needs to contend with tighter financial conditions and lower  levels of housing investment, said Toohey, factors  that had previously helped to offset the slump in the mining sector.  The bank expects gross domestic product (GDP) growth to average  just 2.0 percent next year, down from an estimated 2.9 percent in  2014, as the economy continues to search for new growth drivers. Read MoreAustralias economy slows in Q3  The decline in mining investment will continue to be a major drag  on the economy, leaving commodity exports and consumption to pick  up the slack, the bank said.  Australias third quarter GDP data published on Wednesday pointed  to a sluggish domestic economy, suggesting rebalancing away from  mining-driven growth is taking longer than hoped.    The economy expanded 2.7 percent on year in the three months to  September, undershooting expectations for growth of 3.1 percent,  as construction spending fell while sliding export prices hit  incomes.

Have old tax bills with the IRS? Why you should#The IRS isnt processing paper returns right now as they deal with distributing coronavirus stimulus checks.While thats not an issue for most taxpayers, who currently have until July 15 to turn in their 2019 federal income tax returns and pay any amounts owed, it is a big problem for people who have to file amended returns. These can only be processed on paper.The solution: if you owe something for prior years, pay it now as penalties and interest continue to pile up.
Buckle up! Stocks in risky territory: Bogle#Markets are entering a dicey phase but most investors should not jump ship now, said index fund pioneer Jack  Bogle.   The founder of The Vanguard Group, which manages about $2.5  trillion among its various funds, said in an interview on Mondays edition of Closing Bell that the underlying value of corporate America will  continue to offer investors returns over the long term even if the market suffers a serious plunge.   While famed investor Seth Klarman has recently turned bearish, warning of a potentially  catastrophic asset price bubble, Bogle thinks investors will be better off steeling their nerves and diversifying, rather than trying to time the market.  This is risky territory, and Klarman is heck of a lot  smarter than I am, Bogle said. As the Fed tapers its asset-buying program and raises currently depressed interest rates, stocks could suffer a drop of as much as 20 or 25 percent, he said.  (Watch: Robert Schiller: We have a bubble)  But stock markets move in fits and starts, and the fundamentals  underneath stocks are solid. Corporate operating earnings, for  example, are up 25 percent from 2007, he said.  What does not move in fits and starts is what the stock market  enables you to do, which is own corporate America, he  said.  And corporate America is likely to grow roughly as fast as  nominal GNP—about 5 percent—and dividend yields will  hover around 2 percent. Together, that should bring a  return of about 7 percent over the long term, which should double  an investors money (before inflation) over the next 10 years,  Bogle said.(Watch: Are U.S. equities the biggest bubble?)  Rather than getting out of the market, investors should put some  money into bonds, as ballast against any storms in equities,  and prepare themselves psychologically for the trouble that may come.  But timing market entries and exits is a fools errand, Bogle said.—By Robert Ferris, Special to CNBC.com.
Twitters former Mr. Fixit takes over analytics start-up Mixpanel as#Suhail Doshi started software developer Mixpanel in 2009 after dropping his studies at Arizona State University to join the Y Combinator accelerator program. He was 20 years old.Now, after more than nine years running the data analytics company and dealing with the many highs and lows of Silicon Valley entrepreneur life, Doshi is taking a step back.On Tuesday, Doshi is informing Mixpanels 300 employees at a companywide meeting that hes handing over the CEO role to Amir Movafaghi, the companys head of finance and operations. Doshi will become chairman of the board.I just need a break, Doshi told CNBC. Its been a marathon.With the help of an executive search firm, Doshi went looking for his successor, and in the end decided to promote Movafaghi, who joined the company last year. Prior to Mixpanel, Movafaghi was CFO at software company Spiceworks and before that spent five years at Twitter in finance and global operations.Doshi said the one reference call he made before hiring Movafaghi was to former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo. At Twitter, Movafaghi was Costolos right-hand man.He was the Mr. Fixit at Twitter when there were a whole bunch of problems that others werent willing to fix, Doshi said. Hes the perfect person to lead Mixpanel into the future.
These candidates are out of touch#As 2015 comes to a close, eight debates have given us an opportunity to learn where the top-tier candidates on both sides of the aisle stand on the economic issues that matter most to working families — child care, minimum wage, equal pay and paid family leave. We got useful insights into which candidates support working families — and which ones are ignoring them.  Child care, one of the biggest issues facing Americans today, has received almost no attention. The first five years of a childs life are critical for learning social and emotional skills, as well as for setting them up to be good students and citizens later in life. Once children start school, they often need to attend after-school programs while their parents work. Wondering how to afford safe educational environments for our kids keeps parents up at night.     According to our recent polling, affordable child care is one of the key issues voters say would sway them to vote for a candidate. Yet, it has only come up three times during the debates — once when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton mentioned her support for early childhood education in an answer (before being cut off by the moderator), once when Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders  talked about how his wife, as first lady, could help him address the dysfunctional child care system in the U.S., and once when Florida Senator Marco Rubio was asked about his child tax credit plan. Rubio said that in many states child care costs more than college, and families dont know how they will make their payments every month, let alone save for college. Yet his $2,500 child tax plan is a drop in the bucket compared to the more than $12,000 a year families pay for care for their four-year olds in some states. And it does nothing to support the people who care for our little ones, who are paid, on average, $10.30 an hour. Even Rubio has acknowledged that $10 an hour is not enough to live on.    Child care should be a huge issue for the presidential candidates.  Another issue that would impact the economic security of women and families (and their votes) is the minimum wage. One of the clearest distinctions to come out of the presidential debates has been the Democratic candidates support for, and the Republican  candidates opposition to, raising the federal minimum wage. The current federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour. Raising it would disproportionately benefit women, who are two-thirds of the countrys minimum wage earners, and would help millions of families make ends meet.  Sanders and Maryland Governor Martin OMalley support an increase to $15 per hour and Clinton supports an increase to $12 per hour nationally, as well as $15 per hour in certain areas. Meanwhile, the debates revealed that Donald Trump, Ben Carson  and Rubio are strongly opposed to a minimum wage increase. With women currently paid on average 79 cents for every dollar paid to men, a minimum wage increase is a big deal not just for helping families stay afloat, but also for getting closer to equal pay for women and men.   Consistent with their support for an increase in the federal minimum wage, Sanders and Clinton have been proactive about their support for equal pay for equal work, and Clinton has specifically called for pay transparency and the Paycheck Fairness Act. These policies help address the fact that if women dont know they are being paid differently, its impossible to fix the problem. Yet, on the GOP side, Texas Senator Ted Ted Cruz and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina avoided answering a question about the problem of unequal pay, pivoting instead to a conversation about single moms and rising poverty among women (yet without saying what they would do about it).    On paid family and medical leave, all three Democratic candidates used the debates to express their strong support for it, noting that the United States is one of the only nations in the world without it. In states that have adopted a paid family and medical leave policy, employers and employees alike report benefiting from it. Yet, the Republican debates have been silent on the issue.     In fact, the Republican debates have largely ignored all of the issues that would truly support working families — and only revealed how out of touch the candidates are with the realities of todays workforce. As just one example, take the final Republican debate of the year, when New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, ostensibly one of the most moderate candidates of the batch, talked about about moms dropping off kids at the bus stop while dads went to work. As we end 2015, moms are actually breadwinners in two-thirds of families in the United States. Candidates with outdated views like Christies share a lack of vision for updating our workplace rules to match todays realities.      In 2016, candidates have the opportunity to get even more specific about what they will do to make sure no one has to choose between being there for family and earning a living. Instead of using hate and fear-based rhetoric that stokes anxiety and unrest, candidates should focus on how they will improve the quality of life for the millions of working families in the U.S. The best way to do this: share their visions for national economic solutions that will help us all, together, make it work.

Chipmaker Ambarella gets bump from GoPro#Chipmaker Ambarella may be  small relative to its competitors, but the company is attracting  more interest due to a surging stock and a few high-profile  clients.   The company makes chips that process high-quality video for a  variety of companies including camera maker GoPro—whose stock has surged since going public last week—and search giant Google. Its still small—its market  cap is about $900 million—but the stock has soared more than  95 percent in the past 12 months as investors cheered its growth prospects.   Fermi Wang, the companys CEO, says he first met GoPro founder  and CEO Nick Woodman five years ago at the Consumer Electronics  Show.  Since then, we have been working together closely with the GoPro  team on all of their camera products, Wang tells CNBC. Wang  founded Ambarella in 2004, and the company went public in  2012.   Kevin Cassidy at Stifel Nicolaus, who covers Ambarella, estimates  that GoPro now represents about 25 percent of the companys  business.  On Google wearables, Cassidy says Ambarella won a contract to be  part of Googles Helpouts services, which include a customer  service person helping with fixing your car, or taking Yoga or  Piano lessons through a small video camera linked to a Wi-Fi or  Bluetooth network. Read MoreCramer: GoPro stock is in a sweet  spot  The main driver for Ambarellas business, however, is the  security and surveillance market, said Wang. Clients such as FLIR  Systems and leading surveillance equipment suppliers like  Hikvision rely on Ambarellas technology.IP security cameras constitute 45 percent of its business,  and that segment—which is growing 25 percent year-over-year—is a  bigger growth engine than GoPro, Cassidy said. Axis Communications of Sweden  is its biggest customer, and it has some smaller clients in China,  he said.
Art Cashin remembers market reaction to JFK#Art Cashin was only a few years into what would become a  legendary career on Wall Street when John F. Kennedy was shot in  Dallas.  Like virtually every American who was around then, he remembers where he was when he got the news.  More than that, though, he recalls the market impact  before anyone even knew what was going on. Wall Street  was in sell mode before it became clear what had happened that  fateful day, according to a remembrance Cashin shared with  clients Friday morning.  Cashin, now director of floor operations at UBS, had started at  Thomas McKinnon—now part of Prudential—in 1959. The  1963 assassination happened a year before he would go on to become  a member of the New York Stock Exchange and a partner at P.R.  Herzig.
North Koreas Hwasong-15 missile is new type of ICBM, Seoul#The Hwasong-15 missile that North Korea launched on Wednesday is a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile which can fly over 13,000 km (8,080 miles), a South Korean defense ministry spokesman told Reuters on Friday.Earlier this week, Pyongyang said it had test-fired its most advanced missile, putting the U.S. mainland within range, and in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions.The latest provocation from the North prompted more insults from U.S. President Donald Trump, who referred to North Koreas leader Kim Jong Un as Little Rocket Man and a sick puppy.Trump had also dismissed a Chinese diplomatic effort to rein in North Koreas weapons program as a failure on Thursday, while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Beijing was doing a lot, but could do more to limit oil supplies to Pyongyang. Despite international condemnation and sanctions, North Korea has continued on its path towards developing a nuclear-tipped missile that could hit the United States.

French workers occupy plant as Arcelor decides fate#FLORANGE, France, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Workers occupied thesite of two idle ArcelorMittal  steel furnaces innortheastern France on Monday as management and unions met inParis to decide the fate of a plant that has become a symbol ofthe countrys industrial decline.   Some 40 workers blocked access to management offices at thesteel mill in Florange, in Frances traditional industrialheartland of Lorraine, where two blast furnaces have been out ofoperation since last year due to lack of demand.   Management was due to announce a decision on the fate of thefurnaces, which employ some 550 of the 2,800 workers at theFlorange plant, after a meeting with unions at its Frenchheadquarters.   The rest of the plant is operational.   Socialist President Francois Hollande, who visited Florangewhile campaigning for the May presidential election, met thesteelmakers chief executive Lakshmi Mittal last week to ask himto either restart the furnaces or put the facility up for sale.   The daily Liberation reported that Mittal had given hisconsent in principle to finding a buyer, citing a source inthe presidents office.   Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg said on Sunday thegovernment was seeking contacts with leading steelmakers.   With French unemployment breaking the psychological barrierof 3 million for the first time since June 1999, the Lorraineregion has been hard hit by a slump in industrial demand,particularly for the car sector, which has traditionallyconsumed much of Floranges output.

Meanwhile, it has been enjoying strong demand  in North America, where it has been selling off less profitable  brands like Umbro to focus on core brands like Nike.
How much do you know about Social Security benefits?#Social Security provides about 38 percent of the income for the  elderly, but most Americans would likely flunk a test on the  programs basic details.

(Tweet This) More than seven out of 10 people received a failing  grade. (Take CNBCs quiz below to see how your Social Security  knowledge stacks up.)  Perhaps the greatest Social Security deficit in this  country—and whats lost in todays discussions about Social  Security—is how little most Americans even know about this  retirement benefit, said Michael Fanning, MassMutuals  executive vice president of the U.S. insurance group. While we  didnt expect every person to get 100 percent correct, we  certainly hoped that more would receive a passing grade.

While you can work and receive Social Security retirement  benefits, if you have not reached full retirement age, your  earnings will be subject to a retirement earnings test.  If your income exceeds $15,720 for 2015, for example,  the Social Security Administration  will deduct $1 from your benefit  payments for every $2 you earn above the annual limit.

Putin trying to destroy Ukraine, says prime minister#Ukraines prime minister said on Saturday Russian President  Vladimir Putin aimed to destroy Ukraine as an independent country  and said only NATO could defend the ex-Soviet republic from  external aggression.   Kiev and its Western backers accuse Moscow of sending troops and  tanks into eastern Ukraine in support of pro-Russian separatists  battling Ukrainian forces in a conflict that has killed more than  3,000 people. Russia denies the accusations.   A fragile ceasefire negotiated by envoys from Ukraine, Russia,  the separatists and Europes OSCE security watchdog, has been in  place in eastern Ukraine for more than a week and is broadly  holding despite sporadic violations.

4 phrases to give up if you want to get#You can probably think of 100 reasons why you wont succeed, according to behavioral economics and negotiation expert Keld Jensen.
How to nail a pitch to a &lsquo;Shark&rsquo;#"Being an angel investor is pretty amazing. Youre constantly learning about new businesses and meeting driven entrepreneurs willing to risk everything to follow their dreams. Youre pulling for them, and you hope to be part of their journey in reaching success. Thats why its also heartbreaking when you see an entrepreneur make a misstep because you know how much is at stake!     If you can believe it, Ive seen entrepreneurs pitch and never once mention their own backgrounds ... when they are the most important driver of the business!  Ive also seen entrepreneurs finish pitching, leave the room, and then hear my angel investor colleagues say out loud that they still dont know what the company does.  These are avoidable scenarios. Whether youre pitching to individual angel investors or a tank of Sharks on TV, here are some DOs and DONTs entrepreneurs should keep in mind during their pitch to increase their chances of success.   1. Explain your business model and exactly how you make money. This includes addressing pricing, costs, and margins. Your investors need to understand the economics of solving this problem or serving a need.  2. Explain why YOU are the best team to make this happen. Investors want to know your background and areas of expertise. We need to understand why we would bet on you vs. any other players in the space. 3. Address your competitive edge. That can include intellectual property, patent protection, and exclusive relationships. We need to understand what prevents others from replicating what youre doing. 4. Talk about your long-term vision for the company. This includes growth plans for future products and geographic markets. If youre raising money, we also need to know the terms and your exit strategy for return on capital. 5. Explain how your business scales. We want to know that this is more than just a niche opportunity. Describe how you would grow across a large customer base in various geographies while making the most of limited resources. And explain what your sales and marketing plan is for acquiring customers.   1. Launch into a long story before you say what you do. So dont start by talking about the customers problem, the market, or your team. If you dont tell us what you do first, youve already lost our attention. 2. Forget to address any relevant legal issues and risks. We would never want to be blindsided by a government action or customer lawsuit. Help us understand the potential risks and how youre addressing them. 3. Stretch the truth! Be honest and authentic. Support your claims with facts, research, and data, and independently measure your results. If something sounds too good to be true to us, we know it probably is! 4. Forget to address seasonality or cyclicality of your product or industry.

Is It Possible Tiger Needs To Warm Up?#When Tiger Woods returned from knee surgery a couple weeks ago, it seemed a bit strange that virtually everyone thought he immediately would be in championship form.  Had there ever been an athlete in the history of sports who came back from surgery -- after eight months off -- with fewer questions about the future of his performance?Television ads ran promos of his weekend appearance and Nike  showed its consumers what Tiger would be wearing. Then the worlds No. 1 golfer lost in the second round of the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship and didnt even make it to the weekend. Just a little rusty? Sure. Well give him a mulligan. But weve been watching the leaderboard at WGC-CA Championship in Doral and it doesnt look good for Tiger to win this one either. Through 11 holes today, hes one under par and the current leaders, Jeev Milkha Singh and Prayad Marksaeng, are 11 strokes ahead. So were going ask the taboo question, and maybe its a bit early: Is it possible Tiger isnt as good as he was when he left? Questions?  Comments?  SportsBiz@cnbc.com
More deregulation is coming to the US, Commerce Secretary Wilbur#Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Monday that already thrilled business executives should expect even more regulatory relief over the coming months. I believe a good portion of the reason for why the economy has gotten better is regulatory relief and theres going to be more to come, Ross told CNBC on Monday.Trump has cancelled 860 rules and regulations that had been imposed by the Obama administration and theres barely a single CEO that comes to my office who isnt thrilled with the regulatory relief, he said.Ross said the Trump administration had been able to deliver on deregulation policies because the president was able to exercise his executive powers in order to achieve these aims. And while other campaign pledges were yet to come to fruition, the U.S. commerce secretary said it would be unfair to blame President Donald Trump when Congress fails to act on something.Trump is still searching for his first major legislative victory since becoming president.
Cramers game plan: Between the Fed, China and Apple, get#Investors should prepare themselves for more stock market swings as a host of difficult crosscurrents weigh on equities, CNBCs Jim Cramer said Friday as stocks traded lower.Now that the  has gone negative for the year, let me give you one warning: I think were going to have to slog through these volatility sessions for a bit, Cramer, host of Mad Money, told investors.There are all sorts of difficult crosscurrents here: the trade war with China, the stunning weakness in stocks like bellwether Apple, which got a price target cut from the most influential analyst in the stock, Katy Huberty — it is now down for the year — and, of course, an errant Federal Reserve thats backed itself into a corner when it comes to the next rate hike, he said.Any developments on these complicated issues have the power to sway entire market groups, so Cramer recommended that investors stay vigilant in this challenging layout.Get used to these crosscurrents, because this is the new normal, at least for now, he said.With that in mind, heres Cramers game plan for the week ahead:
Oil demand to jump as Iraq pushes prices higher#As Iraqs mounting unrest pushes crude oil prices to a record  high this year, a report Friday expects that global oil demand  will increase and Iraqs production will be a vital component.The International Energy Agency report forecasts a jump in global  oil demand, which affects both oil and gasoline prices, from 91.4  million barrels per day in 2014s first quarter to 94 million  during its last three months. It also says that Iraq was expected  to account for 60 percent of the production growth from the Organization  of Petroleum Exporting Countries for the rest of this decade.  Iraq, which has the worlds fifth-largest proven oil reserves, is  now OPECs second-largest producer.(Where are oil prices now? Click here)
Rate hike odds spike across the board after Fed minutes#Expectations for a June rate hike jumped as Federal Reserve meeting minutes released Wednesday showed that members would support it if  economic data improved.  Ahead of the release, market  expectations for a rate rise next month were 19 percent, while  the markets were expecting the first rate hike of 2016 to  take place in September, according to the CME Groups FedWatch tool.  After the statement, odds rose in all months tracked by CME:  The odds of rate hikes this year have risen broadly this week, as  several Fed officials delivered hawkish remarks.   On Tuesday, three central bank officials indicated it may  raise rates again soon.
Explosion Rocks Midtown Manhattan#A steam pipe exploded in midtown Manhattan on Wednesday, creating a roar and a huge plume of smoke and sending pedestrians fleeing from the area in scenes reminiscent of the Sept. 11 attacks. Officials in New York and Washington promptly ruled out a terrorist attack. Police at the scene said 15 to 20 people had been taken to hospitals. Boiling, brownish water and steam gushed geyser-like at least 120 feet high (36 metres) out of a crater about 20 feet wide (6 metres) on Lexington Avenue at 41st Street, one of the busiest areas of New York City near the Grand Central transportation hub.
7 successful entrepreneurs share the advice theyd give to their#Its impossible to get everything right in your  20s — after all, theres no handbook for the real  world.   CNBC asked a handful of successful entrepreneurs and  members of the YPO chief executive network what they would tell their younger selves  if they could do it all over. Heres what they had to say:
White House plans to let House release GOP memo on#A hotly debated Republican memo about the FBIs probe into alleged connections between the Trump campaign and Russia could be released Friday, the White House said.President Donald Trump is expected to declassify the note, but the White House said Trump will leave it to lawmakers to make it public. The president has yet to make a final decision.The release could come despite the FBIs grave concerns and the Justice Departments objections. However, NBC News, citing White House officials, said that the White House has agreed to some redactions in the memo at the FBIs request. The redactions, though, would not fix Democrats and the FBIs central problem with the memo: that it leaves out important context and information, making it misleading.An intelligence official told NBC that a formal declassification process is under way, with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence determining which agencies are implicated in the memo, particularly the FBI.
Driverless cars will become like your iPhone: Carmakers#The driverless car will become like your mobile phone: Something  that youll much rather own than hire, leading carmakers told  CNBC as they face the threat that ride-sharing apps such as Uber  could disrupt the autonomous car space.   Last year, Uber, the worlds most valuable start-up, announced it  was developing autonomous vehicles. If you could order a  self-driving taxi at the tap of a button, why would car ownership  be necessary?   But two major auto giants arent worried and said that while Uber  will enjoy great success, the connected car will become a  consumer device that people will want to own.  If you think that you have a car only for mere cold  transportation, then you can take bus, you can take a taxi, and  Uber is going to develop the taxi system…then yes, right,  you dont need to buy a car, Carlos Ghosn, the chief executive  of Renault-Nissan, said during a CNBC technology event at Davos  last week.   But people use a car for many other things and with the  connectivity coming, the car is going to become a kind of working  space, its going to become a living space. Because if in the car  you can connect, interface, video conference… it becomes  your own space, youre going to have your own photos, your own  email, your own music, your own calls, your own everything, it  becomes like your iPhone, you want something belonging to you.
The Fed says it is expanding its municipal bond buying#The Federal Reserve is expanding its municipal bond buying program as part of its efforts to keep money flowing for cash-strapped local and state governments.As part of its Municipal Lending Facility, the Fed is buying up to $500 billion worth of state and local government bonds. In an announcement Monday, the central bank said the facility now will buy debt from counties and states with populations of at least 500,000 and cities with 250,000 residents or more.In addition, the Fed expanded the duration of the bonds it will buy from two years under the previous announcement to three years. The program is limited to investment-grade debt.The Fed also said it will consider in the future buying revenue bonds. Officials will continue to closely monitor conditions in local and state government debt markets as it determines whether to accept the revenue bonds, the announcement added.
Steel Standing?#Tonight, Cramer talks with Dan DiMicco, the CEO of Nucor  about the state of the steel industry. With the Chinese putting the brakes on their economy and the lack of domestic orders here in the US, the steel business seems to be stuck between a rock and a hard place, even as steel prices rise around the world, Cramer said.
Gold 2% higher after disappointing jobs data#Gold settled at a three-week high on Tuesday after weak U.S. jobs figures raised expectations the Federal Reserve will keep its stimulus undiminished well into 2014.Nonfarm payrolls rose by 148,000 in September, the  Labor Department said, below the 180,000 forecast in a Reuters poll, increasing worries that the worlds largest economy was losing momentum even before the government shutdown this month.  We were not even close to the 180,000 number ...  the main takeaway is that Fed tapering is still a long way away, probably not for this year and thats the reason why everything shot up—equities, commodities and gold in particular, Societe Generale analyst Robin Bhar said.The next 24 hours are crucial because on what we  have just seen, gold should hold and even move higher if the dollar weakens.Spot gold, lower initially, rallied 2 percent  to its highest since Oct. 1 at $1,344 an ounce. It was last trading 1.9 percent higher at $1,340 an ounce.The metal has broken above technical resistance at  its 100-day moving average of $1,325. for December delivery settled 2.2 percent higher at $1,342.60 an ounce. The dollar tumbled to a new eight-month low against  a basket of currencies, while global stocks edged up on prospects of a longer spell of super-easy money from the Fed.
US Midwest activity took a breather in December: ISM#The pace of growth in business activity in the U.S. Midwest  slowed for a second month in December, signaling a cooling  in the improvement of the regions manufacturing, a report  showed on Tuesday.  The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago business barometer declined to 59.1 from 63.0 in November, falling short of economists median forecast of 61.0. A year ago, the index was a tad below 50, which is  the threshold that indicates expansion in the regional economy.The gauge of new orders fell to 60.7 from 68.8 in  November, as its production gauge fell to 57.9 from 64.3. The employment component retreated to 51.6, its  lowest since April. In November, it hit 60.9 which was its highest since October 2011.The reports prices paid reading slipped to 63.3  from 63.7 last month.--By Reuters
Home Loan Demand at One-Year High#U.S. mortgage applications rose last week, with demand hitting its highest level in nearly a year as interest rates hovered near recent lows, an industry group said Wednesday.The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted index of mortgage applications, which includes both purchase and refinance loans, for the week ended Nov. 9 increased 5.5 percent to 707.3, its highest since the week ended Dec. 8, 2006, when it touched 721.2.Economists say that this data has been skewed in recent months, however, as prospective borrowers have been filing multiple applications to obtain a single loan due to widespread tightening of lending standards.The MBAs data also counts all applications, including borrowers who are ultimately denied.Borrowing costs on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, excluding fees, averaged 6.19 percent, up 0.03 percentage point from the previous week. Two weeks prior, interest rates reached 6.15 percent, the lowest since the week ended May 11, when they stood at 6.13 percent.Interest rates were above the year-ago level of 6.15 percent.Fixed 15-year mortgage rates averaged 5.77 percent, unchanged from the previous week. Rates on one-year adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) increased to 5.98 percent from 5.94 percent.Overall mortgage applications last week were 9.2 percent above their year-ago level. The four-week moving average of mortgage applications, which smoothes the volatile weekly figures, rose 1.9 percent to 679.0.Demand for both home purchase and refinancing loans rose last week.The MBAs seasonally adjusted purchase index, widely considered a timely gauge of U.S. home sales, rose 4.8 percent to 432.6. The index came in above its year-earlier level of 412.9, a rise of 4.8 percent.The groups seasonally adjusted index of refinancing applications increased 6.4 percent to 2,315.7. The index was up 14.5 percent from a year ago when the index stood at 2,022.2.The refinance share of applications increased to 50.2 percent from 49.1 percent the previous week. Recent U.S. housing industry indexes, while volatile, generally point to a weak outlook for the industry, suggesting a delayed recovery for the hard-hit sector.The National Association of Realtors said on Tuesday pending home sales rose 0.2 percent in September but were still more than 20 percent lower than they were a year ago. Wall Street economists had expected pending sales to fall 2.8 percent.The ARM share of activity increased to 15.5 percent, up from 14.2 percent the previous week.The MBAs survey covers about 50 percent of all U.S. retail residential loans. Respondents include mortgage banks, commercial banks and thrifts.
Donald Trump advisors consider Jamie Dimon for treasury secretary: Sources#In the wake of Donald Trumps upset victory, advisors have  floated the idea of naming Jamie Dimon as  treasury secretary, according to two people familiar with the  matter, but one of them added that the JPMorgan chief  has said he would not be interested in the role.  A Trump spokesperson could not immediately be reached for  comment, and a spokesman for Dimon declined to elaborate beyond  his past remarks that he would not be interested.  It was unclear who within Trumps circle of advisors raised the  idea or who else might be under consideration for treasury  secretary. Trump campaign finance chief Steven Mnuchin, a former  Goldman Sachs official, is reportedly considered to be the front  runner.  Dimon has suggested repeatedly, including in an interview at the  Economic Club of Washington in September, that he would not be  interested in becoming treasury secretary.
Foreclosure Investors are Double-Edged Sword#The best and most expeditious way to clear the vast inventory of foreclosed properties weighing down today’s housing market is to get more investors in and sell them these properties at bulk discounts. That’s what the Obama administration and Federal regulators are currently considering for the thousands of homes currently owned by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the FHA. While big private equity fundsare still largely in a very tedious deal-making stage with banks or waiting on the sidelines for a government program, smaller individual investors are getting in. Nearly 23 percent of home purchases in December were by investors, according to a new survey from Campbell/Inside Mortgage Finance. That is a slight increase from November, but the share has remained largely unchanged for the past year.
Early Movers: WMT, KSS, PG, DWA, HAS & more#Check out which companies are making headlines before the  bell:  Wal-Mart—The retail giant earned $1.15  per share for its latest quarter, 3 cents above estimates, with  revenue and comparable store sales also above estimates.  Wal-Marts results were helped in part by a strong back-to-school  season. Kohls—The retailer missed  estimates by 4 cents with quarterly profit of 70 cents per share,  with revenue also below forecasts and same-store sales falling  more than expected. Procter & Gamble—Berkshire Hathaway is buying P&Gs  Duracell battery business.

NetApp—The cloud-related  products maker beat estimates by 1 cent for its latest  quarter with adjusted profit of 70 cents per share, with revenue  very slightly below estimates. But NetApp gave a light forecast  for the current quarter, as its sales to original equipment  makers slide. Rocket Fuel—The company  posted an adjusted quarterly loss of 18 cents per share, smaller  than the 30 cent loss predicted by analysts. The provider of  advertising technology also had better than expected revenue and  upbeat guidance for the current quarter, seeing strong sales  growth. Microsoft—The computer software and services company will buy  Israeli cybersecurity start-up Aorato for about $200 million,  according to Dow Jones.

Hurricane Season: Protect Portfolio From Unpredictable#Storm season begins June 1st in the Atlantic. And if last year is any indication, the damage could be significant. According to the website TheDailyGreen , Last year, the Atlantic saw 16 named tropical storms -- from Arthur on May 30, which killed five and caused $78 million in damages to Belize, to Hurricane Paloma, which formed Nov. 5 and struck Cuba as a Category 4 monster that was the second-most intense hurricane ever recorded in November. 
USPS chief Louis DeJoy will testify Friday in Senate as#Postmaster General Louis DeJoy will testify Friday before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee as lawmakers speak out against his overhaul of the U.S. Postal Service. The hearing, which is scheduled for 9 a.m. ET before the Republican-led panel, will mark DeJoys first time directly answering questions from Congress about the post office, which has come under intense scrutiny in the runup to the 2020 presidential election.I am pleased to have secured an oversight hearing on Friday with Postmaster General DeJoy in order to address urgent questions on the Postal Service delays that are causing massive disruptions across the country, Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said in a statement Tuesday.As Ranking Member on the only Senate Committee with oversight of the Postal Service, I will continue pressing for answers on Mr. DeJoys recent directives and their impacts on all Americans, who rely on the Postal Service for prescriptions, running their small businesses, voting and other crucial purposes.DeJoys cost-cutting measures at the ailing government agency reportedly include crackdowns on making late delivery trips and cuts to overtime pay and have led to claims of widespread mail delays.Democrats have raised concerns that the changes made by DeJoy, a major donor to Republicans and committees supporting President Donald Trumps reelection, could impact the November election, where the coronavirus pandemic is expected to lead more Americans than ever before to cast their ballots by mail.DeJoy has also come under fire for his business investments, which some Democrats say could pose conflicts of interest. CNN reported last week that DeJoy continues to hold at least $30 million in holdings in his former company XPO Logistics, which is a United States Postal Service contractor. The New York Times, citing financial disclosure forms, reported on Monday that Dejoy received $1.2 million to $7 million in income last year from XPO Logisitics.DeJoy was selected in May by the USPS Board of Governors, all of whom were appointed by Trump. DeJoy is reportedly the first postmaster general in nearly two decades who has not been a career employee of the agency.Trump has repeatedly railed against so-called universal mail-in voting, claiming without evidence that it will lead to massive fraud and a rigged election. He has drawn a distinction between absentee voting — a system he has reportedly utilized as president — and the efforts by some governors to send out ballots to all eligible voters. At the White House on Tuesday, Trump claimed again that widespread mail-in voting will lead to a disaster the likes of which our country has never seen.Itll end up being a rigged election or they will never come out with an outcome. Theyll have to do it again, Trump said. And nobody wants that, and I dont want that.Polls show Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to vote for president by mail, according to a recent Change Research/CNBC poll of likely voters in battleground states.A spokesman for Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, the Republican chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, did not immediately respond to CNBCs request for comment.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., cheered the announcement of the hearing. I am pleased that immense pressure from Senate Democrats and the American people have forced Senate Republicans to confront Postmaster General DeJoys ongoing sabotage of the Postal Service that threatens the integrity of our elections and delays vital services, Schumer said in a statement.Schumer on Monday had pushed Johnson to schedule a hearing with DeJoy after the House Oversight Committee, led by Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., announced that the postmaster general would testify before her panel next week.Robert Duncan, chairman of the USPS board, which selected DeJoy in May, will also testify before the House committee.Peters was one of seven senators who sent a letter Monday urging the Postal Services Board of Governors to reverse DeJoys changes to the agency. That letter noted that if DeJoy refuses to cooperate with their proposed reversal, the board has the authority to remove him.
Goldmans Best Energy Stocks for the Next Six Months#Goldman Sachs, which advised investors to sell oil in April and reversed its stance before prices rebounded a month later, is now the most bullish on four stocks in the industry. The global investment bank is highest on Noble Energy , whose shares may rise 50 percent in the next six months, according to its forecast. Goldman Sachs says Brent crude oil should rise to about $130 a barrel within a year from $114 today, driven by demand in emerging economies.
Executive Decision: Allscripts CEO Glenn Tullman#Back on Aug. 25, Cramer talked with Allscripts Chairman and CEO Glenn Tullman about an upcoming dividend payout that could hurt the stock. Sure enough, there’s been a precipitous drop over the past couple of weeks for just that reason.Tullman returned to Mad Money Friday to fill in investors on the Allscripts’  latest happenings; most importantly that the decline does not represent a drop off in the business, but rather reflects that dividend payout. A quick look at a 30-day chart might confuse unknowing investors, so it’s important to be clear.So what happened? Allscripts has new ownership. Mysis PLC, which trades on the London exchange, merged its Mysis Healthcare Systems division with Allscripts and, for an addition $330 million, took at 54.5% stake in the company. The dividend merger was a payout of this merger. But the newly combined companies have a “shared vision,” Tullman said, and investors shouldn’t be worried about integration problems. So Allscripts, on top of the $70 million already invested in research and development and the one out of three doctors who use the company’s e-prescribing software, now has a better base to sell into and that should accelerate growth over time.But why not just keep that money instead of paying that dividend?“We like to take care of our shareholders,” Tullman said, “and we have what we need to grow today.”Cramer is bullish on Allscripts, a stock he called “a pure Barack Obama play” because the company fits into the Democrat’s plans to cut healthcare costs.Questions for Cramer? Questions, comments, suggestions for the Mad Money website? madcap@cnbc.com
More US Service Jobs Heading Offshore#The strike that crippled two of the nations busiest shipping  ports was settled this week, but the trend it spotlighted —  the offshoring of service jobs — is expected to continue to  grow across the USA.  The eight-day walkout by clerical workers at the ports of Los  Angeles and Long Beach largely centered on the outsourcing of  their jobs overseas and to elsewhere in the U.S., says Craig  Merrilees, a spokesman for the International Longshore and  Warehouse Union. Shippers denied outsourcing jobs, but the  tentative settlement restricts the practice, according to the  Associated Press.Service companies have been sending jobs abroad in large  numbers the past decade to cut labor costs — a trend that  accelerated in the recession and is expected to continue the next  few years before slowing after 2016. About 663,000 large-company  jobs in information technology, human resources, finance and  purchasing — the category that includes the port workers  — have been offshored since 2002, according to The Hackett  Group.  By 2016, the consulting firm estimates, another 375,000 jobs in  the sectors will be moved abroad. More than a third of the U.S.  jobs in those industries in 2002 will have moved offshore by  2016.  Most workers are employed directly by companies that previously  used U.S. staffers, though some work for outsourcing firms.  Hackett studied companies with at least $1 billion in annual  revenue, noting they represent about 75% of the offshoring  market.  India is the largest offshoring center. Service jobs also have  gone to eastern Europe, the Philippines, China and Mexico.(Read More: How Immigrants Are Changing U.S. Businesses)  In other sectors, initially low-level jobs were offshored, such  as handling payroll or tracking purchase orders. Employers  typically can cut labor costs by about 75 percent, Dorr says. In recent  years, a growing number of higher-level jobs have moved overseas,  such as benefits analysis and vendor management, though the cost  savings for offshoring those positions is only about 25 percent.The  trend took off after companies began contracting with programmers  in India to help with the massive preparations for the Y2K  computer bug in 2000, says Hackett research director Erik Dorr.  Organizations now feel more comfortable moving up the value  chain, Dorr says, noting, for example, that Indias education  system is improving and turning out top-notch job candidates.  Since 2005, legal services such as document review, contract  drafting and regulatory communication increasingly have been  offshored, particularly to India, says Greg McPolin, managing  director of Pangea3, a legal outsourcing firm. Indian attorneys  handle work that in the U.S. is sometimes done by paralegals and  at a 40 to 60 percent cost savings, he says.  Several thousand legal jobs have been offshored, estimates Edward  Brooks, founder of The LPO Program, a legal consulting firm.  In the current environment, it is more important than ever that  … the support we provide to clients adds value without  adding unnecessary cost, law firm Clifford Chance said in a  statement.  Once services are offshored, theres little chance theyll come  back to the U.S., Dorr says. By contrast, manufacturers have  returned some production to the U.S. recently, largely because of  a narrowing wage gap between the U.S. and China, rising shipping  costs and falling U.S. energy costs — factors that generally  havent affected service jobs.  One exception: call-centers. About 500,000 of these jobs were offshored  from 2006 to 2010, according to the Communications Workers of  America. Many have returned to the U.S. the last few years  because of cultural gaps between representatives and customers  that hurt sales, says Hal Sirkin, senior partner of Boston  Consulting Group.  Still, CWA spokeswoman Candice Johnson called the jobs that have  come back a drop in the bucket.

COMMODITIES-Down after post-storm oil supply boost; cocoa jumps#* Foreign oil tankers help ease supply crunch in US Northeast* Little focus on better-than-expected US jobs data for Oct* Oil prices lose 2 pct on the day; Brent down 4 pct* Gold hits 2-month low; copper ends down for 4th week* Cocoa rallies on Ghana supply squeeze, bucking weak trendNEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Oil prices tumbled on Friday as foreign tankers were allowed to bring fuel from U.S. ports to the Northeast to ease a supply crunch after Hurricane Sandy, and metals and other key commodities fell on worries the devastation from the storm could hamper the economic recovery. The declines wiped out Thursdays gains that came after markets appeared to gain a sense of normalcy following the massive storm earlier this week that killed at least 102 people. Many in the stricken region were still without power, gasoline and information about when their shattered lives might return to normal. Oil prices fell more than 2 percent on the day, with U.S. crude settling below $85 a barrel and Londons Brent finishing under $106. Brent, which affects global oil prices more than U.S. crude, fell nearly 4 percent on the week. Gasoline futures in New York also fell more than 2 percent, to below $2.58 per gallon, as oil tankers and pipelines supplying New Jersey and the New York Harbor - the delivery point for the U.S. contract - restored more operations that had been roiled by the hurricane. The Thomson Reuters-Jefferies CRB index, a bellwether for commodities, fell 1.6 percent after 14 of its 19 components settled in negative territory. The selloff came despite a stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report for October which ordinarily would have sent prices rallying. While oil and gasoline fell over 2 percent, natural gas was the CRBs biggest loser for the day. It tumbled 4 percent on milder weather forecasts for the U.S. Northeast next week that reduced the potential demand for gas as a heating fuel. Oil came under pressure after the U.S. government temporarily waived Jones Act restrictions on tankers carrying fuel from the Gulf Coast refining hub to the hard-hit Northeast, increasing the fleet of ships that would normally be confined to domestic vessels and crews. ``I think economic uncertainty and next weeks (U.S.) elections are weighing on oil prices. You also have the statement that the Jones Act is going to be waived for a week, suggesting some supplies are going to return, said analyst Gene McGillian at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.GOLD AT 2-MONTH LOW, COPPER DOWN U.S. gold futures hit a two-month low below $1,700 an ounce and were down almost 2 percent this week, settling at below $1,682 to mark a fourth consecutive weekly decline. Gold has erased all its gains made after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced its latest bond buybacks to boost the job market in September. ``Better-than-expected numbers reduced the risk demand for gold, and a drop below $1,700 an ounce triggered sell-stops and momentum selling, said James Steel, metals analyst at HSBC. ``There are also long liquidation ahead of elections triggered by the job number, Steel said. Copper prices fell for a fourth consecutive week. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange closed at $7,665.50 a tonne in official rings, down 2 percent from Thursdays close of $7,826 a tonne. Corn and soybeans fell about 2 percent each on Midwest harvest projections that suggested both crops may be larger than previously thought.COCOA BUCKS LOWER TREND Cocoa bucked the weakness in other commodities, pushing above technical support levels as some exports faced a holdup and purchases slowed in the main West African growing region. New York-traded cocoa futures closed up $27, or 1.1 percent, at $2,447 per tonne, as traders watched the early progress of main crop harvests in West Africa. The market climbed for a second straight day after hitting its 200-day moving average around $2,352. Cocoa purchases in Ghana, the worlds second-biggest producer of the crop, stood at 86,028 tonnes by Oct. 19 in the first week of the season, down 42 percent from the same period a year ago, trade data showed on Thursday. The numbers were lower than expected and were helping to underpin the market, traders said.Prices at 4:30 p.m. EDT (2030 GMT)
House passes bill to avoid a government shutdown for two#The House passed a bill Thursday to fund the government for two months and avoid another shutdown. The Democratic-held chamber approved the measure to keep the government running through Nov. 21 by a 301-123 margin. It now heads to the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has signaled he will back a temporary spending plan. Congress has until Sept. 30 to pass a funding bill and prevent a funding lapse. A shutdown would come only months after a partial government work stoppage in December and January that lasted a record 35 days. Last month, lawmakers approved a two-year deal to set budget levels, suspend the U.S. debt ceiling and dodge automatic, across-the-board spending cuts. However, passing the appropriations bills to actually allocate the money to specific agencies has proven harder to do before the shutdown deadline. So Congress decided to pass a so-called continuing resolution to extend funding at current levels and keep the government running through most of November. Democrats and Republicans will now have to come to agreement on long-term spending bills amid yet another dispute over border security and military funding. On Wednesday, Senate Democrats blocked GOP efforts to move forward with spending bills for the Defense Department and other agencies. The party argues Republicans have neglected key domestic programs and military funding by yielding to Trumps demands for more funding for barriers on the U.S.-Mexico border.Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., accused the party of playing partisan politics. ﻿Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.
Flash China Caixin PMI falls to 47.1 in August#The preliminary reading for a key  Chinese purchasing managers index  (PMI) fell to a near six-and-a-half-year low of 47.1 in  August, below a Reuters forecast of 47.7, underscoring persistent  sluggishness in countrys vast factory sector.  The final Caixin China PMI dropped to a  two-year low of 47.8 in July, while the official  China PMI avoided falling into contraction territory by coming in  at 50 for the month. Caixins China PMI data tends to focus on  smaller and medium-sized companies, filling a niche that isnt  covered by the official data.  The Caixin Flash China General Manufacturing PMI for August has  fallen further from Julys two-year low, indicating that the  economy is still in the process of bottoming out, said He Fan,  chief economist at Caixin Insight Group.  There is still pressure on maintaining growth rates, and to  realize the goal set for this year the government needs to fine  tune fiscal and monetary policies to ensure macroeconomic  stability and speed up the structural reform, added said.   A reading above 50 indicates expanding activity and one below 50  signals contraction.  Read MoreCaixin China PMI for  July at two-year low A breakdown of the August survey showed both the new orders  and new export orders sub-indexes declining at a faster rate than  in July – a sign of accelerating weakness in domestic and  external demand.   Recent data out of the worlds second largest economy have  signaled weakening growth momentum in the second half of the  year.  A spate of economic activity data for July published earlier this  month - including industrial production, retail sales and fixed  asset investment - came in below market expectations,  underscoring the Peoples Bank of Chinas move to weaken the  yuan. Last week, the central bank surprised markets by sharply  devaluing the yuan, which the government said was part of reforms  meant to make its exchange rate more market-oriented.
Fed holds off, markets now betting on hike in 2016#Stocks fluctuated and bonds rallied after the Federal Reserve  held off on a first rate hike and said global economic and market  developments threaten the U.S. economy.  There is enough economic activity to allow the Fed to think  about raising interest rates, but theres not enough inflationary  pressure to allow them to do so, said Scott Clemons, chief  investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman Wealth  Management.  According to RBS, market expectations for the first full rate  hike are now priced into March, and the odds of a December hike  fell to 64 percent from 84 percent.

Trump officials say China pursuing blame game on breakdown of#U.S. President Donald Trumps administration said on Monday that China was pursuing a blame game in recent public statements and a weekend white paper that misrepresented the trade negotiations between the worlds two largest economies.   In a joint statement, the U.S. Trade Representatives (USTR) office and the U.S. Treasury reiterated their view that Chinas negotiators had backpedaled on important elements of a deal that had been largely agreed, including on an enforcement provision.   Our insistence on detailed and enforceable commitments from the Chinese in no way constitutes a threat to Chinese sovereignty, USTR and the Treasury said. Rather, the issues discussed are common to trade agreements and are necessary to address the systemic issues that have contributed to persistent and unsustainable trade deficits.   China on Sunday issued a government policy paper on the U.S.-China trade dispute in which it asserted that the United States bore responsibility for setbacks in the talks, citing three instances in which Washington had backtracked on commitments made during the negotiations.  Chinas Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen, a prominent member of Beijings negotiating team, said in presenting the paper to the media that it would be impossible for the United States to use extreme pressure to force concessions from China.   Acrimonious rhetoric between Beijing and Washington has steadily increased since talks broke down in early May over U.S. accusations that Beijing had backtracked on commitments to codify in law changes to its intellectual property and technology transfer practices to address U.S. demands.   President Donald Trump imposed an increase in tariffs to 25% on a $200 billion list of Chinese goods on May 10, saying that China broke the deal. His administration later imposed severe sanctions against Huawei Technologies Co, Chinas premier telecommunications equipment firm.  The United States is disappointed that the Chinese have chosen in the White Paper issued (on Sunday) and recent public statements to pursue a blame game misrepresenting the nature and history of trade negotiations between the two countries, USTR and Treasury said in the statement.   The agencies, which have taken the lead in negotiations for the U.S. side, said that the impetus for the negotiations wasChinas long history of unfair trade practices, and U.S. negotiating positions have been consistent throughout the talks.   There have been no talks scheduled since the last round ended in May, and it remains unclear whether Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will meet when they both attend the G20 leaders summit later this month in Japan.
Chinas Lenovo Q2 net profit rises 36%, beats forecasts#Chinas Lenovo Group, the  worlds number one manufacturer of PCs, said net profit  jumped 36 percent in its fiscal second quarter, beating  estimates as it continues to chase growth  through acquisitions.  Lenovo, with a 17.3 percent share of worldwide PC shipments  according to research firm IDC, reported net profit of  $219.7 million for the July-September period and said it  remains confident the Chinese economy is recovering.

Layoffs needed because market is changing so rapidly: HPs Whitman#Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman said Wednesday the  company embarked on another round of layoffs in part because  the technology market is changing so rapidly.  Its remarkable whats happening to our services  business. As new technologies come in, weve got to  restructure that labor force to low-cost locations, to much more  automation than we have today, she told CNBCs Squawk on the Street.  On Tuesday, Hewlett-Packard announced it would cut 25,000 to 30,000  positions as part of its restructuring, which will split the  company into two separate firms, one focused on enterprise  services and one dedicated to its legacy hardware business.  The reductions will primarily impact workers at HP Enterprise  Services, the companys business and technology services unit. Read More Charts: Chip  stocks breaking out?  The layoffs come on top of 55,000 cuts announced in recent years  and would further reduce Hewlett-Packards 300,000-person  workforce by about 10 percent.   The cuts over the last four years were focused on helping HP  achieve a cost structure that was in line with its revenue  trajectory, Whitman said. The reductions announced Tuesday will  help HP expand its profit margins, she added  These cuts are never easy, but its the right thing to do  because we have to now get to the next phase of the HP journey,  she said.  Whitman will serve as CEO of the services-focused Hewlett-Packard  Enterprise when it splits from its hardware business, which will  be known as HP Inc, in November.  The company expects the layoffs will save about $2.7 billion a year, though Hewlett-Packard said it will take a $2.7  billion charge to carry out the reductions. Some of those costs  will begin accruing in the fourth quarter of this year.  The company also expects the share of its workers employed  overseas in low-cost locations to grow to 60 percent by 2018 from  42 percent today.Read More  Tencents $1.6B plan to take on Alibaba, Amazon in cloud  Whitman said the companies would return Hewlett Packard to profit  next year following the split. She had previously said that would  happen prior to the separation.  Asked what makes her confident that growth will happen this time,  she identified the separated companies focus, their competitive  sharpness, and their ability to achieve the right capital  structure.  Its hard to forecast in markets that are as changing, as fast  as ours, but I think we have a good handle on this now. she  said. We feel really good about our product lineup, our services  lineup, and our go-to-market strengths, which I think will stand  us in good stead for FY 16.
Germany Should Have Ratings Cut to Save Euro: Strategist#Germany, the euro zones largest economy, should be prepared to take a downgrade to its AAA-rated debt to help save the single currency area, Charles Diebel, head of market strategy at Lloyds, told CNBC Wednesday.
After-hours movers: Disney, Aeropostale & more#Take a look at some of Wednesdays after-hours movers: Disney gained in extended-hours  trade on news that the company will increase its annual cash  dividend by 34 percent, to $1.15 a share, payable on Jan. 8,  2015, to eligible shareholders. Aeropostale fell more than 9  percent in after-hours trade after the teen retailer posted a loss  for the eighth straight quarter, hurt by slower mall traffic,  higher discounts and lower demand for its clothing. Guess edged lower before turning slightly higher in extended-hours  trade after posting third-quarter results that showed a decrease in revenues around the world and a weaker full-year outlook. PVH, whose brands include Calvin  Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, fell more than 1 percent in extended-hours  trade on weak guidance. Fluor edged higher in after-hours  trade on the engineering and construction firms announcement  that ICA Fluor, its joint venture with Mexican infrastructure firm  Empresas ICA, won a $1.3 billion contract to expand a refinery in  Mexico. Avago Technologies gained more than  5 percent in extended-hours trade after the Singapore-based chipmaker posted fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations. Verint Systems fell more than 3  percent in after-hours trade when the software firm narrowed its full-year revenue outlook.Wires contributed to this report.
First Solar Down After Short-Seller Comments#First Solar shares  fell after short-seller James Chanos said insider stock selling and executives leaving the company is never a good combination.You are seeing patterns that short sellers love, the president of Kynokos Associates told CNBC Thursday.  Theres been enormous insider selling. The chairman has gotten rid of most of his stock in the last year and a half. And lots of people are leaving.Shorting is selling assets, usually securities, that have been borrowed from a third party with the intention of buying identical assets back at a later date to return to the lender. Short sellers like Chanos want to profit from a decline in the price of the assets between the sale and the repurchase.
Ad shift from TV to digital will speed up even#Ad budgets were already shifting from TV to digital before the coronavirus pandemic, but thats going to speed up, according to a Europe-focused report by Goldman Sachs.Overall, we expect the crisis will only accelerate the secular shift in advertising budgets towards digital, while potentially also leading to more attempts by the EU broadcasters to seek further partnerships and M&A (mergers and acquisitions) to share costs and build scale, according to the companys Europe Media: Broadcasting report, seen by CNBC.Brands are able to measure the impact of online ads more easily than those on TV, and digital ads tend to be cheaper — and it appears the pandemic has had more of an impact on TV ad revenue than digital. TV ad revenue in Europe was down by about 50% in April, while the results of the major digital players were generally above expectations, Goldman noted. Google search revenue was down mid-teens, while Facebooks revenue growth for the first three weeks of April was flat and Snaps went up 15% in April, the report added.A separate report from the World Advertising Research Center (WARC) showed that global marketing budgets for digital advertising in April fell for the first time since WARC started tracking spend in 2012. Advertising in printed newspapers and magazines saw the steepest declines followed by outdoor billboards, radio and TV.
Lasry: Europe could face Japan-style deflation era#Europe could be looking at a Japan-style deflationary environment  for the next five years, investor Marc Lasry told CNBC on  Wednesday. Read MoreEuro tests low last  seen at its birth in1999  Lasrys Avenue Capital is continuing to buy credit-side debt at a  discount in Europe. Over the last three or four years, the amount  of debt that European banks have sold has increased by 100  percent, he said in a Squawk  Box interview.   The way that the banks were able to sell this debt is, they keep  on buying sovereign debt, and then through that they make their  profits, and then each year they end up using those profits to  offset losses on that. And thats sort of of what happened in  Japan over a 10 year period, said Lasry, who specializes in  distressed debt investments.  Read More Can cash-strapped Europe  prevent terrorism surge?  The way for Europe to avoid a deflationary period is to clock 4  to 5 percent GDP growth, he said.   Youre not having that. The reason everybody focuses on that is  because GDP growth in Europe today is sort of, negative one,  flat, up one. Its really not moving that much, he said.  The chairman and CEO of Avenue Capital said his firm is playing  the credit side of the European debt market because the pressure  is still on the banks to deleverage. This is sort of a five year  process, so for us its going to be the gift that keeps on  giving, he said.  Lasry is personally invested in Greek debt, but Avenue Capital  does not buy sovereign bonds, he said. Read More Should markets fear  Greeces radical Syriza party?  Europe is still in an investing phase because there is $2.5  trillion of debt, he said. The supply side in Europe is still so  great relative to the demand side in Europe, he added.
Could Chinas Bird Flu Be the Next SARS?#As the death toll from a deadly strain of bird flu in China rises  to 17, China watchers say they are closely following Beijings  handling of the outbreak although officials appear to have  learned a trick or two from the SARS crisis a decade ago.  Eight fresh cases of the H7N9 bird flu virus have been reported  in the eastern provinces of China this week, bringing the total  figure of those infected to 82, Reuters reported. China is also  investigating the possibility of human-to-human transmission of  bird flu, a top Chinese health official was quoted as saying on  Thursday.  Some analysts are drawing parallels with the outbreak of severe  acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) between 2002 and 2003, which  damaged international trade between China and  other countries and led to the virtual shut down of Beijing, Chinas  capital city.  If the bird flu epidemic accelerates in a similar fashion,  investor sentiment could be severely damaged, said one analyst.  The obvious benchmark is SARS. That was a catastrophe and the  Chinese government learnt a lot of lessons from that, said Tim  Condon, head of research for Asia at ING Financial Markets.  At the moment the bird flu outbreak appears to be under control,  but if it turns out to be much more virulent than expected you  could see the same sort of reaction as we saw to SARS, he said.  The outbreak of SARS, a viral respiratory disease spread between  humans, in South China and Hong Kong between the end of 2002 and  the summer of 2003, affected around 8,000 and led to more than  700 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. Beijing  was criticized at the time for its handling of the outbreak and  downplaying the crisis, which led to panic and hurt Chinas  economy.  (Read More: )
British Airways fined £20 million for data breach that affected#LONDON — British Airways has been fined £20 million ($26 million) by the Information Commissioners Office (ICO) in the U.K. over a data breach in 2018 that left the personal and financial details of 429,612 BA customers exposed.Following an investigation spanning almost two years, the ICO concluded that British Airways did not have sufficient security measures in place to process significant amounts of personal data.The regulator said the failure broke data protection law.While the fine is less than the £183 million the ICO said it would issue in 2019, it is still the largest-fine ever issued by the watchdog, which said the economic impact of Covid-19 had to be taken into account.The attacker is believed to have accessed the names, addresses, payment card numbers and CVV numbers of 244,000 British Airways customers.A further 77,000 customers had their combined card and CVV numbers accessed, and an additional 108,000 customers had just their card numbers accessed.The regulator said that the usernames and passwords of up to 612 BA Executive Club members may also have been compromised.It took British Airways more than two months to realize it had suffered a data breach.Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said in a statement: People entrusted their personal details to BA and BA failed to take adequate measures to keep those details secure.Their failure to act was unacceptable and affected hundreds of thousands of people, which may have caused some anxiety and distress as a result. Thats why we have issued BA with a £20 million fine – our biggest to date.When organizations take poor decisions around peoples personal data, that can have a real impact on peoples lives. The law now gives us the tools to encourage businesses to make better decisions about data, including investing in up-to-date security.A British Airways spokesperson told CNBC: We alerted customers as soon as we became aware of the criminal attack on our systems in 2018 and are sorry we fell short of our customers expectations.We are pleased the ICO recognizes that we have made considerable improvements to the security of our systems since the attack and that we fully co-operated with its investigation.

Number of mortgages in coronavirus bailout program jumps 21,000 after#The number of mortgages in active pandemic-related bailout plans rose by 21,000 in the past week after declining for six straight weeks, according to Black Knight, a mortgage technology and analytics firm. The increase was not across all mortgage types but among bank-held and private-labeled security loans (28,000), and, to a lesser extent, among FHA/VA loans (2,000). Those increases were offset by a decline of 9,000 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans in forbearance.The government and private sector forbearance programs, initiated at the start of the pandemic, allow borrowers to delay their monthly payments for at least three months and for up to a year. Forbearance is granted in three-month terms, and so far more than 75% of borrowers in bailouts are on extensions since March.As of the 29th [of September], nearly 800,000 forbearance plans were still set to expire in September, down from 2 million at the start of the month. The data is still coming in, but over the past week, weve seen a roughly 80% extension rate, said Andy Walden, director of market research at Black Knight. Given that there are another million plans for which October marks the last payment covered by forbearance, we should expect to see heightened levels of expiration/extension activity in the coming weeks.As of Tuesday, roughly 3.6 million homeowners remain in pandemic-related forbearance plans. Thats 6.8% of all active mortgages, representing $751 billion in unpaid principal.While the weekly turn is troubling, over the past month active forbearance volumes have fallen by 305,000, or 8%. FHA and VA loans, which generally go to borrowers with lower incomes and lower down payments, are not recovering as well as the rest of the market. It is likely those borrowers are in jobs that have been hardest hit by the pandemic.It is impossible to know specifically why more borrowers suddenly needed help on their mortgages, but it is a sign that all is not improving in the housing market. Some borrowers have been dipping into savings to make their monthly payments, and that may have now run dry. While the economy is adding jobs again, the unemployment rate is still high, and some borrowers are still clearly struggling. By loan type, 4.7% of all Fannie and Freddie-backed loans are in forbearance, while 11.2% of all FHA/VA loans are. For private label and bank-held loans, that share is 7.3%.

Three major pharmaceutical companies just reported earnings — heres how#Shares of pharmaceutical giants Pfizer and Merck both rose by about 1% Tuesday after reporting first-quarter financial results that beat Wall Streets expectations.However, shares of drug giant Eli Lilly dropped as much as 3.5% after releasing first-quarter earnings that topped profit expectations, but missed on revenue. Sales of two of Lillys key drugs, Trulicity and Alimta, fell short of Wall Streets forecasts. Mercks earnings got a slight lift from sales of cancer immunotherapy drug Keytruda and vaccines — amid the worst measles outbreak since health officials declared the disease eradicated from the U.S. in 2000.
Some voters are scared the coronavirus will stop them from#Erica Friedle had not missed a vote in seven years. Then came the coronavirus pandemic.Friedle told CNBC she didnt receive her absentee ballot for Aprils Wisconsin presidential primary. And now she fears that a lack of preparation by state officials and the continued threat of the disease might force her to sit out the upcoming November election in the swing state. As health officials predict that the pandemic might last into the fall, many states are beginning to plan for the likelihood of people opting to vote by mail instead of showing up in person, where the risk of contracting and spreading the coronavirus is greater. For some people, the coronavirus has made voting a nerve-wracking action. Some Americans and voting rights groups are concerned that the pandemic is forcing voters to choose between avoiding contact with people to stay healthy and exercising their right to vote. Come November, these concerns might linger.Are people going to want to stay in line to vote? Are people going to be requesting absentee ballots? Do people even have the technology to request a ballot online? Friedle asked, listing out some of her immediate worries in an interview with CNBC. There are so many unknowns right now.The Wisconsin primary in particular has been criticized for its disorganization and last-minute changes, leading to voter confusion and disenfranchisement and serves as an example of what voting rights groups hope will not happen in November.Complicating matters, President Donald Trump and members of the Republican Party are on the attack against widespread mail-in voting while Democrats push for expanded access. Late last month, Trump threatened to withhold funding from Michigan and Nevada for expanding their mail-in voting services in an effort to avoid crowded polling centers during the coronavirus pandemic. More and more states are allowing vote-by-mail without voters having to provide a reason or excuse for it, said Andrea Hailey, CEO of Vote.org, a nonprofit focusing on advancing voter ballot access. Other states are mailing applications to voters, which is critical for ensuring that all voters can participate in the electoral process.More than half, or 54%, of Americans said they would back voting by mail in the upcoming presidential election if the pandemic persists, according to an April Morning Consult poll. And 66% of surveyed Americans said in March that they were concerned about voting in person during the coronavirus outbreak. We are seeing signs that voters are registering at numbers unseen from our organization, and that they are very much interested in voting by absentee, Hailey told CNBC in an email.But mail-in voting can bring its own concerns, especially if there are underlying circumstances that affect support, such as the potential for U.S. Postal Service operation failure or miscommunication between state officials and voters.Friedle, a second-grade teacher, said she applied for an absentee ballot but did not receive it ahead of the Wisconsin presidential primary on April 7. She is a single mother with a 10-year-old child, sharing custody with her ex-husband, a scientist at a large pharmaceutical company who at the time of the primary had been working on a vaccine for Covid-19.The combination of being unable to leave her child alone and fearing getting sick at the polls made Friedle miss the vote.  I didnt want to put myself at risk for getting sick, she said. Ive been taking care of my daughter the whole time. Her father works crazy hours, and at that time, he was telling me he might get locked out in his work, that he wouldnt be able to leave his work.She added: That just made me nervous. Whos gonna watch my daughter? Friedle, 41, is not within the most vulnerable age group for contracting the most severe form of the virus. But theres still a lot at stake for people like Friedle: parents with young kids or teachers whose students are relying on them even as online classes persist. Knowing the risks, Friedle chose instead to skip out on voting. She feared if she contracted the virus, she would pass it on to her daughter or potentially be unable to teach. Voting rights groups stress that the most susceptible people are older voters and people with pre-existing conditions, according to Brett Edkins, political director at New York-based Stand Up America, a nonprofit focused on advancing Democratic goals. Children and younger parents are at relatively low risk of becoming seriously ill. Election experts across the partisan divide say that mail-in voting is the safest alternative to in-person voting.But Friedles experience during the Wisconsin primary gave her a taste of what November might look like for her and other voters across the nation, she said. Shes hoping to see her state take action in the coming months to reduce the likelihood of people experiencing what she did. This includes having multiple ways to vote, whether you want to vote early, via an absentee ballot or in person.At the same time, shes concerned about whether officials are considering the feasibility of these moves. How can we do that? How can we do it safely so people arent being exposed to germs or viruses? she asked. Lots of organizations are out there that drive people to the polls. Are people still organizing these things with Covid going on?In other states, some voters are concerned that there wont be enough done to make in-person voting safer. Angel Wells, a frequent voter and a self-described human rights activist based in Arizona, said thats whats driving her fears today. Voting can get chaotic in Arizona, said Wells, a veteran. In her voting area, there are 64 voting offices where you can cast your vote. But thats not enough when you live in a valley with millions of people.When people go out to vote, those lines are long. The polling booths are close [together]. Theyre not six feet apart. How are we supposed to have this vote and keep within health guidelines? People are rightly concerned about having to choose between their right to vote and their health, Edkins of Stand Up America said. I think were hearing a lot of those concerns from our community and from voters everywhere.

Everybodys missing how Apples subtle approach could drive its stock#Apples big event may have failed to impress investors on Monday — but those investors are actually missing the point of the tech giants new services, tech investor Gene Munster told CNBC on Monday.Shares of Apple closed down 1.2 percent after the highly anticipated event, which introduced its streaming video service Apple TV+, a paid news service Apple News+ , a credit card and a gaming service called Arcade. Apple did not announce many details about the services, including pricing for TV+ and Arcade. But Munster says investors who focus on the missing details are missing the bigger picture.What Apple is saying is they are going to take things that we interact with every day -- whether its the streaming service, gaming or our credit card – and were going to try to change in terms how people use that. The language that they use is enriching peoples lives, said Munster, founder of the venture capitalist firm Loup Ventures.That means creating content that isnt typical, gaming thats healthier, and a credit card that adds transparency, he added.That gets lost in the conversation today — these subtle little approaches that Apple does to make our lives just a little bit better. And I think that ultimately is going to yield a higher share price, Munster said on Fast Money.
Is the Fed Prepping Markets for the End of#If an article in Mondays Wall Street Journal is anything to go  by, the U.S. Federal Reserve is getting ready to unwind its  massive monetary stimulus program. And that prospect is unlikely  to be as alarming for financial markets as feared, analysts tell  CNBC. Fed officials have mapped out a strategy to wind down its $85  billion-a-month bond-buying program in careful steps, although  the timing of when that will start is still being debated, noted  Fed watcher Jon Hilsenrath wrote in the WSJ. Any unwinding of the Feds quantitative easing (QE) program,  which has fueled a rally in equity markets and other risk assets,  is generally viewed as negative and any indication of this  happening has been highly anticipated in the U.S. since late last  week. (Read More: If I Were Dictator,QE Would End Now, Feds Lacker  Says) Having spent two New York sessions pricing in a sharp change in  Fed stance, it is not obvious that the article was worth the  wait, analysts at Westpac said in a note. The timing of the  unwinding of QE remains data-dependent, not a serious prospect  until perhaps late U.S. summer at the earliest.Analysts say that in essence, the Fed appears to be managing  market expectations that its quantitative easing program will not  last forever.The Fed has said that it would maintain its key interest rate  between zero and 0.25 percent until the unemployment rate fell to  6.5 percent. It has also committed to monthly purchases of bonds  until labor market conditions improve substantially. (Read More: Are Bond Vigilantes Taking On the Fed?)
Ted Nugent to Meet Secret Service Over Obama Words#Ted Nugent says hell meet with the Secret Service to explain his comments about President Barack Obama that some have interpreted as threatening.The hard rocker says it will be obvious when he talks to agents on Thursday that he didnt make any threats.

CCTV Script 20/01/15#— This is the script of CNBCs news report for Chinas CCTV on  January 20, Tuesday.  2015 has not only been volatile for commodities, the foreign  exchange market has been topsy turvy as well, with some calling  it the currency war.  Weve already seen cuts this year by India and Peru. The Swiss  National Bank shocked markets last week by scrapping its 1,20  francs per euro cap. The Swiss central bank had earlier cut its  rate down down to -1.25% to -0.25% range. Today, Denmark  announced its own cut to its benchmark policy and lending rates  and Japans BoJ will announced their policy decision tomorrow, on  the back of a two-day meeting.  All eyes are now on the ECB and their policy meeting on Thursday.  90% of analysts expect a QE program from Mario Draghi and his  team, with a medium predict of at least 550 billion euro.[Megan Greene, MD & Chief Economist, Manulife Asset Management] My big fear is they are gonna actually engage in QE, and  that its gonna be a total damp squid 071632 and then they will  have used up all of their dry powder, so what else can they bring  out to fight deflation.[Sean Darby, Global Head of Equity Strategy, Jefferies] But the problem really is the central bank has got limited  options to some extent in trying to increase inflation rate, and  this one is the only one at the moment left on the menu card.  The BOJ, though, is expected to keep its current QQE program and  interest rate unchanged. With the U.S. economy back on track to  stronger growth, the Fed is expected to raise interest rates  around mid 2015, which will bring challenges to emerging markets.  Theres still just over more than 11 months left to this year and  already, some analysts are saying that 2015 is going to be a year  for Central Banks.
First Colorado county reports pot taxes#A southern Colorado county with two recreational marijuana stores  has become the first in the state to announce tax totals from the  new industry.  Pueblo County finance authorities announced Monday that its two  shops had about $1 million in total sales in January, producing  about $56,000 in local sales taxes.  Pueblo County is the only place between Denver and the New Mexico  state line that currently allows recreational pot stores. Its two  shops were joined by three more that opened in February.  (Watch: )   We recognize that the eyes of the world are watching us, and we  are proud to have erected a robust regulatory environment in  Pueblo County, County Commissioner Sal Pace said in a statement  Tuesday.  Pueblo County Clerk Gilbert Bo Ortiz projected the marijuana  industry will generate roughly $670,000 in new tax revenue for  his county this year. The money is a combination of a 3.5 percent  pot sales tax approved by county voters last year, as well as  share-backs from the state on general and pot-specific sales  taxes.
Euro rises vs. yen, dollar after data eases ECB concern#The euro traded near a five-year peak against the yen and a  one-month high against the dollar on Friday after euro zone  economic data dented speculation about further  monetary easing by the European Central Bank.  Annual euro zone consumer price inflation rose by 0.9 percent  in November, slightly more than economists had predicted,  while further data revealed the first fall in euro zone  unemployment in almost three years.  Analysts said this should be sufficient to ease the ECBs  concerns about low inflation and may cause them to hold off  from a further interest rate cut as early as next week to  follow an unexpected rate cut earlier this month.  The euro rose to as high as $1.3621, according to Reuters data,  the strongest since the end of October, before easing to  $1.3609, little changed on the day.
Sara Lee Drops on No-Takeover Report (Update)#UPDATE: The Sara Lee story: it is likely about price and inflationTheDeal.com report that a sale of SLE is unlikely dropped the stock about 4 percent. Reports abound that the Board is meeting today to consider selling pieces of the company, such as the meat or coffee division, or breaking it into separate pieces. The likely problem: inability to agree on a price. Why? Because food companies are in a tough environment, an environment that cannot be easily changed just by getting bigger. The big issue for food companies: inflation. Bernstein, in a recent note to clients, noted that cost of goods sold (COGS) inflation will average 6.7 percent for 2011 for the large food companies like SLE, Kraft , Kellogg  and Campbells . That is up from a 5 percent estimate that was done in October and way above the 3-5 percent sweet spot preferred by many management teams, they say. Knock-on effects: 1) commodity inflation causes food stocks to underperform because margins get hit 2) when food prices go up, private labels gain market share 3) innovation becomes more important: the ability to raise prices often depends on the ability to introduce new products, rather than renovate existing ones. -----Sara Lee was down as much as 4 percent Thursday on a story in TheDeal.com that a sale of the company appears unlikely, citing unnamed sources. The company  has been widely believed to be a takeover target, or that it might separately sell its meat or beverage businesses. A number of players, including Apollo Global Management and KKR, have reportedly expressed interest in a buyout. Recall that CEO Brenda Barnes stepped down in August for health reasons. Though SLE has many well-known brand names (Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm), its a tough sell: the food business is highly competitive, and as we have seen in other companies, it is tough to get pricing power. Higher commodity costs, as has been widely reported, add to the uncertainty.More:Fast Money Traders: What Commodities Are Saying Now_____________________________Bookmark CNBC Data Pages:__________________________________________________________Want updates whenever a TraderTalk blog is filed?

Cancer Study Shows Over 7.5 Million Deaths in 2007#More than seven-and-a-half million people -- or about 20,000 people a day -- will die of cancer this 2007. Thats the sobering new estimate from a first-of-its-kind global study out of the American Cancer Society. The report says that nearly three million cancer deaths will occur in economically developed countries … and more than four-and-a-half million in developing countries.The publication also includes scary projections about tobacco-related deaths.  The ACS estimates more than one billion people will die this century from tobacco use -- a ten-fold increase over the 20th century.  Some of the most devastating projections are in China where 350 million people smoke cigarettes.  Thats more than the entire population of the United States.The study says stopping tobacco use in the developing world should be an urgent global health priority.

Tony NYC suburb welcomes NJs first pot dispensary#MONTCLAIR, N.J. -- Across New Jersey, most communities approached about hosting one of the states first legal medical marijuana dispensaries in out-of-the-way industrial zones have just said no, after outpourings of public opposition.Montclair is a different story.The cosmopolitan suburb a half-hour train ride from Manhattan has not only allowed Greenleaf Compassion Center _ which last week received the state Health Departments first license to begin providing pot to patients _ but also let the business set up in the middle of the towns main drag, and with no fuss.For plenty of people in the way left-of-center town, the situation is a source of both pride and nonchalance.Why are the other communities so closed-minded as to not accept something like that? said Peter Ryby, owner of Montclair Book Store, around the corner and down the block from the not-yet-opened alternative treatment center.The town of 38,000 is sometimes called the Upper West Side of New Jersey, referring to the famously upscale and liberal part of Manhattan, but its also reminiscent of well-heeled bohemian spots such as Boulder, Colo., and Berkeley, Calif. Theres an art museum, an international film festival, a Whole Foods, Thai restaurants, racks for commuters bikes, and the headquarters of Garden State Equality, New Jerseys largest gay-rights group.The population _ 62 percent white, 27 percent black _ is racially integrated and largely well-to-do. The median household income is $140,000.And the idea of tolerance is part of the towns identity. In a scene in Mad Men, a TV drama set in the 1960s, characters who went to Montclair for a party were stunned to see black and white revelers together _ and marijuana being passed around.Medical marijuana is a dicey business. In the eyes of the federal government, the medicine is still an illegal drug.Some patients say marijuana can ease symptoms associated with conditions ranging from multiple sclerosis to migraines. It has been used to treat pain, nausea and lack of appetite in cancer and AIDS patients.Seventeen states and Washington, D.C., have flouted federal law and passed some sort of statute to allow patients access to the drug.Each state has its own model for how the cannabis can be distributed. Some, like New Jersey _ where advocates lament and some officials brag that the laws are the nations strictest _ are still in a startup phase.So far, nine states _ Arizona, California, Colorado, Maine, Michigan, Montana, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington _ have dispensaries operating. Some states are still setting up distribution systems, and some use home-grown marijuana or other setups that do not include dispensaries.Chris Goldstein, a spokesman for both the Philadelphia chapter of the pro-pot group NORML and the Coalition for Medical Marijuana of New Jersey, has visited dispensaries all over the country. He said most of the storefront operations look more like the one ready to open in Montclair than those proposed in industrial districts of New Jersey.The dispensaries are in the higher-end neighborhoods of California towns. There are people who are wealthy and who are poor who need to access medical marijuana, he said. In New Jersey, its wherever the dispensary can get their location.New Jersey is not allowing registered patients to grow their own, and is limiting the potency, amount and variety of pot patients can buy. Theres a relatively short list of conditions that qualify patients for the drug, and unlike some more lenient states, chronic pain and anxiety arent on it.Only New Jersey residents are eligible. New York, easily reachable by rail, does not allow medical marijuana, though lawmakers have proposed doing so.Last year, the New Jersey Department of Health selected six nonprofit groups to pursue plans to grow and sell cannabis. The other five have struggled to find towns that will accept them, and none yet has permission to start growing marijuana, let alone sell it.Groups are planning sites in Egg Harbor Township and Woodbridge. The other three groups have not announced their latest location plans.Only Greenleaf has had a direct path. In its application, the group said it would meet patients in Montclair and grow its plants in another, undisclosed town. The group wont say where, citing security.A year ago, Janice Talley, Montclairs director of planning and community development, found that the site on Bloomfield Avenue _ next door to an abortion clinic and three buildings down from an adult video store that has pipes and vaporizers displayed for sale _ would be a permissible for the new business under zoning laws.Talley said she fielded complaints from some national anti-marijuana groups. Nobody from the town called me and complained why we had that facility, she said. It wasnt a huge issue here.Behind the counter at Health Love and Soul Juice Bar and Grill a couple doors down from Greenleaf, Jarisi Anderson, said hes all for the new establishment. Its a beautiful thing, he said.His co-worker, Queen Townsend, fears the place could be a problem, but she believes shes in the minority. The people Ive met in Montclair _ I dont want to stereotype _ a lot of people here smoke weed, she said. They dont have a problem with that.The guys smoking tobacco down the street at Fume, a cigar shop, said they arent troubled by legalizing marijuana _ medicinal or not. Its a waste to lock somebody up for a nickel bag or a dime bag, said shop owner Ralph Alberto.But the dispensary could give the non-Montclair residents who go there to protest another cause.Last week, Bernadette Grant stood across the street from the dispensarys neighboring abortion clinic with rosary beads in one hand and anti-abortion pamphlets in the other. She said she considers medical marijuana in the same category as abortion.This is not pro-life , she said. This is pro-death.___Follow Mulvihill at http://www.twitter.com/geoffmulvihill

Facebook is facing a level of uncertainty it hasn’t seen#Facebooks ability to manage its data scandal will ultimately determine its long-term future, according to Goldman Sachs.Facebook was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 on Monday, posting its biggest one-day decline since March 2014. This followed reports over the weekend that political analytics firm Cambridge Analytica was able to collect data on 50 million peoples profiles without their consent.The London-based company worked on Facebook ads with the Trump campaign, providing details on American voters.Facebook has come under fire for its role in the scandal and has been accused of mishandling users data. It certainly introduces a level of uncertainty that we havent seen with Facebook before, Heath Terry, lead internet research analyst at Goldman Sachs, told CNBC on Tuesday.Terry said every fast-growing tech giant was likely to face a similar crisis, such as the so-called click fraud scandal that threatened Googles growth prospects in recent years.Thats going to be the same here for Facebook. Its going to be how they manage through this that will ultimately determine their long-term future, Terry said.

FOREX-Dollar firm vs yen and euro before U.S. jobs data#* Upbeat U.S. private payrolls data boosts dollar* Yen hampered by Japans trade deficit, economic woes* Euro has been hit by Greek court ruling on austerity stepsLONDON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - The dollar rose to a near four month-high against the yen on Friday as investors bet on an upbeat U.S. payrolls report after private employers added jobs at the fastest pace in eight months. The euro fell to a three-week low against the dollar on selling by long-term investors. The euro has also been under pressure since a Greek court ruled on Thursday that pension reform demanded by foreign lenders may be unconstitutional. That raised concerns about Athens ability to implement the austerity measures needed to secure bailout funds. All these drove the dollar index to a seven-week high of 80.389, breaking above its 55-day moving average of 80.14. The dollar was up 0.2 percent on the day at 80.31 yen, just shy of last weeks four-month high of 80.38. Traders reported an option barrier at 80.50 yen with hedge funds ready to buy the dollar on dips if the U.S. jobs numbers disappointed. A break of resistance at 80.60-65, a chart triple top marked between May and June and a 50 percent retracement of the dollars March to September decline, could signal further gains. ``A good U.S. jobs number will no doubt give a leg up to dollar/yen, said John Hardy, currency strategist at Saxo Bank. ``From a medium-term view, we are bullish on dollar/yen and the pair has established a base around 79 yen for a rally to 88 yen in a years time, he said. The yen has come under pressure because recent Japanese data and corporate earnings have been soft. Third-quarter economic output data, due on Nov. 11, is also likely to have contracted. Payrolls processor Automatic Data Processing said private employers added 158,000 workers last month, bolstering expectations that the non-farm payrolls report due at 1230 GMT may beat forecasts. A Reuters poll forecasts a rise of 125,000 U.S. non-farm payrolls in October. The unemployment rate is seen ticking up to 7.9 percent. Any market reaction to the jobs data may be short-lived given the uncertainty of the outcome of Tuesdays U.S. presidential election.EURO ZONE STRUGGLES Some, however, are less sure about a sustained rise in the dollar as investors fret over the so-called ``fiscal cliff of looming tax rises and spending cuts in the United States. ``Over the course of the next month we would expect to move lower in dollar/yen, any upside above 81 would be surprising driven by U.S. negativity surrounding the fiscal cliff, said Christian Lawrence, currency strategist at Rabobank. The euro fell 0.4 percent to $1.2885, a three-week low, as traders sold the single currency, triggering an option barrier at $1.2880. Bids from Asian central banks and Middle East investors were cited below $1.2850. However, the euro held within the $1.2800-3200 range seen since September, underpinned by the European Central Banks pledge to buy bonds of indebted euro zone countries that seek aid. Signals in the option market showed the pair was likely to trade in a range in coming weeks. The one-month implied volatility on euro/dollar options fell to fresh five-year lows around 7.50 percent. Data on Friday showed peripheral euro zone countries were still struggling. Spains manufacturing sector shrank last month at it fastest pace since July, while Italian factory activity shrank in October for the 15th month running. Commodity currencies eased after rallying earlier in the day. The Australian dollar hit a five-week high of $1.0420 before giving up gains to stand at $1.0380 as caution set in before the U.S. jobs data. The currency was helped by Thursdays improvement in manufacturing data from China, Australias main export market.

WALL-E Cleans Up at Box Office#Animation giant Pixar scored its ninth consecutive No. 1 Sunday with its robot love story WALL-E, while Angelina Jolie achieved a personal best with her violent assassination thriller Wanted. WALL-E, bolstered by near-unanimous critical praise, sold an estimated $62.5 million of tickets in its first three days, said Pixars Walt Disney Co parent.It tied with 2001s Monsters, Inc. to become Pixars third-best opener.Pixar has gone to No. 1 with all nine of its movies, an unprecedented run that begin in 1995 with Toy Story. The company record of $70.5 million was set in 2004 by The Incredibles. Industry pundits had forecast an opening for WALL-E in the $50 million to $60 million range.Anything north of 60 (million dollars), we were going to be ecstatic, said Mark Zoradi, president of Walt Disney Studios Motion Picture Group .Meanwhile Jolie, whose career has been overshadowed in recent years by breathless tabloid coverage of her personal life, kicked off at No. 2 with Wanted. The Universal Pictures release earned about $51.1 million, easily beating forecasts of an opening in the mid- to high-$30 million range.Her previous record for a live-action movie was 2005s Mr. & Mrs. Smith, which opened to $50 million.The General Electric Co-owned studio  said Wanted ranks as the third-highest opening for an R-rated action film, behind The Matrix Reloaded ($91.7 million) and 300 ($70.9 million).SALES SOAR WALL-E and Wanted, clearly aimed at disparate audiences, helped pushed overall sales to their highest level of the year, said tracking firm Media By Numbers.The top 12 films grossed $179 million, up 29 percent from last weekend, and up 20 percent from the year-ago period, when Pixars Ratatouille opened at No. 1 with $47 million on its way to $206 million.Last weekends champion, the Warner Bros spy comedy Get Smart, slipped to No. 3 with $20 million, taking its 10-day haul to $77.3 million.The film, which stars Steve Carell as the inept hero Maxwell Smart, should finish up with about $130 million, said the Time Warner Inc-owned studio .Rounding out the top five, Pixar rival DreamWorks Animation SKG Incs Kung Fu Panda slipped one to No. 4 with $11.7 million, taking its total to $179.3 million.The film opened four weeks ago to $60.2 million.Marvel Entertainment Incs The Incredible Hulk fell three to No. 5 with $9.2 million.The superhero adaptation has earned $115.5 million after three weeks, roughly on par with its unloved 2003 predecessor The Hulk. WALL-E, a space adventure mixing an unusual love story with somber messages about the future of Earth and humankind, was directed by Andrew Stanton, who won an Academy Award for Pixars 2003 hit Finding Nemo. The title character, or Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class, is the last of a cadre of robots tasked with cleaning up piles of trash discarded by humans who abandoned the planet centuries before.The human race set off on a luxury space cruise during a planned five-year clean-up that lasts much longer and results in unfortunate changes in the human physique and psyche.The arrival of a sleek girl robot named Eve, sent to Earth by the orbiting humans to look for plant life, sends Wall-E on an adventure that changes his own and humanitys destinies.Critics heaped praise on the film.According to Rotten Tomatoes, a Web site that collects reviews, an astonishing 96 percent of critics liked the film.Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune said on TVs Ebert & Roeper that it was perhaps the best American studio picture of the year, but the Hollywood Reporter said it might be too clever to connect with mainstream audiences. Disneys Zoradi said WALL-E was not a conventional cartoon, but the studio was confident from the get-go that it would work.He declined to reveal the films budget, in line with Disneys policy.WALL-E also opened at No. 1 in six small foreign markets, led by Brazil with $1.6 million, Zoradi said.It will reach Russia and Mexico next weekend, followed by the U.K. in mid-July, timed with the school holidays in each market.Wanted, a $74 million comic book adaptation directed by Kazakhstan-born filmmaker Timur Bekmambetov, stars Scottish actor James McAvoy (The Last King of Scotland) as an office drone recruited to an elite order of assassins by Jolie and Morgan Freeman.Critics were also enthused.______________________________An earlier version of this story had outdated box office information.
What to make of the Fed minutes: El-Erian#The minutes released Wednesday by the Federal Reserve are a must-read for those interested in the complexity of modern central banking—if only for the striking contrast between the milquetoast discussion of the economy and the many policy and market complexities.    There is little that is new or noteworthy in the sections on economic developments and prospects. The bottom line is also a repeat of what has characterized many post-global financial crisis minutes: a more muted immediate economic outlook (growth and inflation) coupled with somewhat greater optimism for the longer term—all on a baseline characterized by the usual references to modest, moderate and cautious.   By continuing the practice of compensating for a somewhat softer short-term outlook with upward adjustments thereafter, the FOMC is sidestepping an issue that has now entered the mainstream lexicon with a bang because of recent remarks by Larry Summers and Paul Krugman. Its whats being called secular stagnation and what Pimco in 2009 labeled the new normal—namely, a prolonged period of low growth and persistently slow job creation.    The minutes rather subdued economic discussion contrasts with the large number of open policy (and therefore market) questions.    (Read more: Fickle Fed: Taper could arrive in coming months)   From the interaction between the two main tools (asset purchases and forward policy guidance) to the consideration of new ones (lowering IOER), and from how and when to taper to the best way to communicate with markets, the minutes paint a truly complicated policy mosaic. Further, it is one that is still in the making and whose ultimate shape—and therefore impact—is subject to considerable uncertainty.   The complexity also extends to the specification of the intermediate policy targets that are so crucial for fine-tuning the policy response and thus delivering desired outcomes. Specifically, Fed officials posed the legitimate question of whether the commonly followed unemployment rate overstates the improvement in the labor market and, probably more controversial, whether it makes sense to add an inflation floor.    Finally, the minutes suggest that this is a Fed that is contemplating not only what could go right if it continues on the current policy path but also what could go badly wrong.    For this reason, officials considered scenarios under which it might, at some stage, be appropriate to begin to wind down the program before an unambiguous further improvement in the economic outlook was apparent. Why? Because of concerns about the efficacy or costs of further asset prices.    Such complexity can paralyze market participants at a time when the Fed in particular and central banks in general continue to play an important role in asset price determination. Yet some aspects are less ambiguous.   (Read more: Good news: Bubble concern is at a five-year high)   Taken in their entirety, the minutes provide further support for a consequential hypothesis: As part of a forthcoming policy evolution, the Fed wishes to encourage markets to delink their assessment of the two main policy tools—thereby enabling Fed officials to strengthen forward policy guidance, reduce (very gradually and carefully) heavy reliance on balance sheet operations and avoid a repeat of the May-June disruptions to the functioning of markets.    Fed officials may even be tempted into cutting IOER as a way to help manage this tricky and uncertain policy pivot.  (Read more: Yellen must promote strong recovery)   This is the reason why Pimco stresses greater differentiation in portfolio positioning.   We have been favoring the front end of interest rate curves while shying away from the long end—a point that my colleague, Bill Gross, has stressed repeatedly in his writings and tweets. It is also why, given current price levels, we feel that risk assets are becoming consequentially more dependent on a proper recovery in fundamentals and not just continued policy support.    And it is why we believe that greater attention should be devoted to recent disparities in performance among and within some major asset classes.

Fragmented UK would be bad for debt ratings, says Fitch#Britains impending exit from the European Union (EU) as well as the potential breakaway of Scotland would be a bad scenario, according to the global head of sovereigns at Fitch Ratings.A fragmented U.K. is a bad scenario from a ratings perspective because it would raise the debt-to-GDP (gross domestic product) of the remaining U.K. government by somewhere around 8 to 10 percentage points of GDP, warned James McCormack, speaking to CNBC on Wednesday from the IIF G20 summit in Frankfurt.Last time there was a referendum we talked a lot about this, said there were potential negative ratings implications, the same would be true this time, added McCormack, the executive with chief responsibility for countries debt ratings.The Fitch executive highlighted that following the triggering of Article 50 to initiate the Brexit process - widely signaled to happen before the end of this month - all parties involved will be facing the great unknown in terms of how the decoupling of the U.K. from the trading bloc plays out.I think from the U.K.s perspective they want to get as many things started as possible. From the European perspective, they want to go nice and slow and do things in the proper order, he opined.This weeks confirmation that Scotlands First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, would seek to hold another referendum before the spring of 2019 asking her compatriots whether they would like to split off from the rest of the U.K., simply added a further twist to the complicated path ahead for the U.K. government, McCormack said.While a lack of clarity over when exactly such a vote would be held was additionally unhelpful, the reality is that it would be difficult for the U.K. government no matter what the timing.A lot of political capital is going to be required on both fronts, he added.
Britains May sets out Brexit vision for trade deal deeper#British Prime Minister Theresa May set out her vision on Friday for a Brexit deal deeper and wider than any free trade agreement in the world, telling the European Union it is in their shared interest. Below are the highlights from her speech and a follow-up question-and-answer session with reporters:
Morgan Stanley earnings, revenue top expectations#Morgan Stanleys third-quarter revenue jumped  50 percent, helping adjusted earnings beat expectations, as  higher income from equities sales and trading made up for a  drop in the Wall Street bank and brokerages fixed-income  business.  Morgan Stanley reported net income of $888 million, or 44 cents  per share, from continuing operations in the quarter. That  compared with a loss of $1 billion, or 55 cents per share, a  year earlier.  The year-earlier figure included a charge of $2.3 billion to  reflect a rise in the value of Morgan Stanleys debt.
Moodys lowers outlook on Amazon to negative#Moodys Investors Service cut its outlook on Amazon.com from stable to negative on  Monday, prompted by the online retailers announcement that it was  issuing new debt.   The credit rating agency also affirmed the companys Baa1 senior unsecured rating.Following the news, Amazon stock dropped more than 3 percent.
Halftime Report: Technical Break Could Signal S&P 950#On the last trading day of the month, the Dow and S&P turned sharply lower around lunchtime with investors eager to move to the sidelines.Negative sentiment seemed to prevail after a Labor Department report showed personal spending dipped 0.5 percent in September, while personal income was flat.Those figures again turned attention to the fragile state of the consumer – which is considered vital to a recovery because consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of all U.S. economic activity.Also the dollar  turned higher. Lately the greenback has had an inverse impact on equities.On the final trading day of the month, the S&P 500 was down 0.99 percent for October. If the index is unable to hold onto the months gains, it will snap a seven-month winning streakWhat should you be watching?I think we’re looking at more of a psychological phenomenon in the market than anything else, says Steve Grasso of Stuart Frankel. This is the last day of the fiscal year for most mutual funds. Usually we see losses in October and this time we’ve had gains. So money managers are locking in profits on the last day of the month. But that doesn’t change the fact stocks are selling off. I’m watching 1042 on the S&P, he adds. If we close below that level, technically we open the door to S&P 1000.I think the action is absolutely horrible, adds Joe Terranova. Technically it looks awful. If the E-Mini S&P futures break below 3700 I think we may have an ugly close.Warren Buffett often says be fearful when other are greedy and greedy when other are fearful. I ‘do’ think you can dip your toe into best of breed names, especially in commodities, he adds. But only do it knowing that declines are coming from professional investors who are moving to the sidelines because they are fearful of what they’re seeing in the market.
Here are the 10 most important stories for investors Friday#A daily morning look at the financial stories you need to know to start the day.STOCKS/ ECONOMY-Stock futures are a bit higher after Thursdays rally. Consumer sentiment numbers come out at 10 AM Eastern Time. OIL/ ENERGY-U.S. crude prices are up to the $53 a barrel level on news that OPEC has been complying with its production cut targets.  But natural gas prices are close to falling back below the $3-level.TRUMP FIRST 100 DAYS-The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously ruled against the Trump administrations new immigration and travel ban policy. The administration may now take this fight to the Supreme Court.
Heres what major analysts think of Apples stock after announcements#(This story is for CNBC Pro subscribers only.)Apples announcements from the WWDC conference — from its new software to a shift to in-house chips — are garnering praise from Wall Street analysts. Many of them hiked their forecast for the tech giants stock.During the remote event Monday, Apple introduced new software for its iPhones, iPads, Macs, Apple TV and Apple Watch. It also announced that future Macs will use chips made by Apple instead of Intel, a move that it said will mean faster laptops and desktops.UBS said its bullish on Apples transition to its own chips, calling it a continuation of its strategy of vertical integration following years of convergence in its mobile and Macs. The bank increased it 12- month price target to $400 from $325, representing a near 12% upside from here.
Why Apple shareholders shouldnt be too worried after the earnings#If you are an Apple shareholder who wondered after last weeks stellar earnings report why the value of your stock holding was going down rather than up, the reason given — that chip shortages will weigh on the short-term outlook — may not seem good enough. For a trader looking at every short-term opportunity to move portfolio money to where the next quick buck is likely to be, it doesnt take more than that sell on the news headline. Longer-term investors, though, might want to consider a recent fact about the company and negative headlines: Apple has overcome pretty much every short-term sell headline in recent years on its way to being a $2-trillion-plus company.Trumps trade war with China? No problem. The surprise decision to stop offering iPhone unit guidance? Much ado about nothing as the iPhone super-cycle came along anyway. As for the global semiconductor chip shortage now being cited by Apple, it might be wise to keep in mind that Apple has a long history of being pretty conservative with its outlook — formal earnings guidance still has not returned. And one more thing: Tim Cook was elevated to the CEO post after Steve Jobs based on his mastery of global logistics.Lets face it, if Apple has any trouble getting chips, then every other company on the planet will have 10x those problems, said Nick Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. If youre really worried about chip supply, you want to own Apple because it is first in line at every chip fab.But there is a bigger question relevant to Apple and the rest of the market: Just how strong is the next leg of growth for the market going to be?
Stocks Pare Losses After Housing-Induced Slide#Stocks pared their losses Tuesday as homebuilder, telecom and some consumer stocks recovered after a sharp drop triggered by a dismal report on home sales.
Jim Cramer breaks down how to discover overlooked stock picks#At-home investors may be wondering how to find overlooked companies in which to buy shares at a time when a historic bull market enters another decade and concerns about valuations are present.The way to start, according to CNBCs Jim Cramer, is a process called a read-through.So much of successful investing is about read-throughs, dissecting the less obvious pin action when a company reports earnings, the Mad Money host said.To illustrate the process, Cramer took a look at two of the best read-throughs of Thursdays session, which saw all three major averages again close at record highs.Those companies are Micron, which rose almost 3%, and Darden Restaurants, the parent of Olive Garden, which closed down around 6% after a light quarter.Successful read-throughs of a company start at the top, Cramer said. To make money, you have to be able to believe the CEO, he said.Otherwise its all just blather, he said.With Micron, President and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra has been a straight shooter about both the good and bad facing the company, Cramer said.So when Mehrotra says the current quarter is the trough for the business, you can believe him, Cramer said.And if Micron is expecting a pickup in business, Cramer said, other companies related to it in the semiconductor space could present attractive investing opportunities.Western Digital is a name to look at, Cramer said. Mehrotra mentioned tightness in the flash memory category, and Western Digital is a competitor there.While not all aspects of its business are winners, such as disk drives, Cramer said he thinks it can continue marching higher; its up nearly 60% year to date.In the past, when the cycles turned ... this $58 stock has rallied through $100 — its hit those lofty levels twice in the last five years, he said. I think Western Digital can do it again.Micron also indicated softness around PCs, attributing it to Intel having trouble making chips, Cramer said.What does that mean for those doing a read-through? Look to AMD, Intels main competitor.Another reason to buy AMD, Cramer said.Cramer said executing a read-through on Darden follows the same process, starting with credibility of management and analyzing what was said on the conference call.Darden pointed to Olive Garden as the main culprit for its revenue coming in slightly below estimates.The stock got slammed [and] looked like it would take the whole restaurant cohort with it, given the pervasive presence of the bargain Italian chain, Cramer said.It wouldnt have been a far-fetched assumption to attribute it to the consumer reining in its spending, Cramer said. But on the conference call, Darden CEO Gene Lee pointed to poor execution and promotion of Olive Garden.Lee is trustworthy, though, Cramer said, and his clear-eyed assessment of the situation was valuable insight. It meant the casual dining segment remained strong. And what to do with that information?You should buy Chipotle, Cramer said.Cramer emphasized that the read-through process is just a starting point, and you never just buy any of these stocks.Its easier for professional analysts to spend more time assessing stocks, he said, and I know thats hard for people at home.But the bottom line? Now you know at least what a read-through means, and if youve got the time, you can do this same analysis yourself to identify overlooked ugly ducklings that, down the road, turn into beautiful swans, he said.
UPDATE 2-Serb central bank raises key rate to 10.75 pct#* Rate rise of 25 basis points tied to inflation, retailprices hike   * Future policy moves hinge on inflation, fiscalconsolidation(Updates with IMF report, background)   By Aleksandar Vasovic   BELGRADE, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Serbias central bank raised itsbenchmark interest, already the regions highest, by 25 basispoints to 10.75 percent on Tuesday, reflecting rising inflationand debt concerns.   Other central banks in Central and Eastern Europe have cutrates over the past two weeks, as growth slows across theregion, although Poland bucked the trend last week by keepingrates flat due to concerns over inflation.   Serbia stands out as an exception because of a cocktail ofrising inflation and debt and an economy sliding into recessionamidst crisis in the euro-zone, its main trading partner.   Considering that the increase of food prices andstate-controlled prices is higher than expected and thatinflationary expectations are on the rise, the Executive Boardhas decided to increase the benchmark rate  toprevent the spillover... to other prices, the Serbian bank saidin a statement.   Serbian inflation in August rose to 7.9 percent, up from 6.1percent in July, due to a poor harvest and the governments bidto finance its 2012 budget gap amounting to 6.2 percent of GDPthrough a rise in value-added tax.   The central bank estimates that inflation should continue torise until mid-2013 and then slide back to its target band offour percent, give or take 1.5 percentage points, the same asfor 2012. However, some analysts voiced caution.    That inflation is not driven by demand ... in that sense,the monetary policy is powerless, said Miladin Kovacevic, ananalyst with the Belgarde-based Economics Institute.    Djordje Djukic, a lecturer of economics with BelgradeUniversity, said Tuesdays rate hike was beneficial forportfolio investors, who will make profits on short-termmaturities, but bad for budget and debt.   The effects (of the rate hike) on inflation are veryuncertain as the Serbian economy is highly monopolised andplagued by high production costs, low productivity andcompetitiveness, Djukic said.   RISING DEBT   The deficit, inflation and rising social discontent haveprompted the coalition government of nationalists andSocialists, which came to power in July, to borrow more. Thatincluded a Sept. 27 issue of a $1 billion Eurobond and a $1billion loan from Russia, planned for this year and next.   Serbias total public debt this year is expected to reach 60percent of GDP and the country wants a new stand-by loan dealwith the International Monetary Fund to reassure investors.   The Fund froze a 1-billion euro ($1.30 billion) loan dealwith Belgrade in February over inflated spending and debt andtold Serbia last month to restore the autonomy of the centralbank and rein in spending before any new loan talks.   In its October World Economic Outlook, the lender saidSerbias economy was expected to contract by 0.5 percent thisyear and grow 2 percent in 2013.   In the statement, the central bank said its future policymoves would depend on inflationary expectations, externalinfluences and the effects of fiscal consolidation.   The dinar  rallied versus the European commoncurrency last month after domestic banks started issuinggovernment-subsidised loans to aid exporters hit by the crisisin the euro zone, Serbias main trade partner.  The dinar has been trading at an average of 115 dinars to oneeuro since, as opposed to an average 117.5 in the days beforeits recovery. By midday on Tuesday, following the rateannouncement, it firmed against the euro and was trading atbetween 114.56 and 114.76 to one euro.

What an Earthquake Can Teach You About Problem Solving#On a 1-10 scale: how do you respond to problems? Try this technique. Whenever theres an earthquake——the first thing you wonder is, How bad was it on the Richter scale? Im a big fan of the Richter scale, even though I dont really understand it. The scale goes from 1-10, but the smallest earthquake that can be felt (Websters), only gets a 2. If I were in an earthquake that could be felt and it only got a 2, Id be extremely disappointed.
Review: Google Nest Hubs new smart display can read your#Googles Nest Hub Max, a larger version of the Nest Hub that was announced during Google I/O in June, is now available for purchase. Ive been using it for the past several days, so I wanted to let you know what its like.Its similar to the Nest Hub, which launched last year and serves as a smart display that lets you watch YouTube TV ($50 a month), stream music and speak to Google Assistant. It also helps you learn more about your day, with information on your commute to work, reminders and more.The Nest Hub Max represents yet another way Google is getting into our homes, and this time with a camera. Its similar to the Facebook Portal+, but it has a smaller display and can do a lot more. Its also Googles answer to Amazons line of Echo Show products, which range in size, price and capability.While the $129 Nest Hub is best served in places like the bedroom, given its small 7-inch screen, Google wants the $229 Nest Hub Max and its larger 10-inch screen to take over your kitchen or living room. It has a camera for video chats with family or for monitoring your house while youre away. That camera can also recognize each member of your familys face, so it can display unique information for each person it sees.Heres what you need to know.
Its Time for the Lightning Round!#Pride International : This is a contract driller and a stock that Cramer likes in this market. “Let’s buy it.” American Software : It’s a fine tech company, Cramer said, but he’d rather go with names like Riverbed Technology , Cisco , Hewlett-Packard  or Dell . Peabody Energy : Even though oil is up, the government is not helping coal companies like Peabody, Cramer said. He has liked coal, but it’s not at the right level right now. Foundry Networks : “This happens to be another stock in the sweet spot,” Cramer said. He believes stocks like FDRY, which didn’t go down at all today, are going to work in this environment because they don’t need debt, they don’t have to do a leveraged buyout and they don’t need the domestic consumer.RPM International : “It’s not going to work, but it’s not going to hurt you either,” Cramer said. Anadigics : If you look, you’ll see that most tech stocks, including ANAD are at or close to a 52-week high. “I can hold on to that,” Cramer said. Applied Materials : A company with low valuation and a lot of cash, and it’s moving into solar. Cramer predicts one down and three up for AMAT, which to him says “buy, buy, buy.” Immersion : Immersion has never made anyone money, Cramer said. Sell it. Cumulus Media : It’s been straight down since it announced it would be bought out on Monday, Cramer said. “I need you out of Cumulus.” Intel : Intel is one of the reasons why Cramer is so bullish on Dell and Hewlett-Packard, as they are big buyers of Intel chips. That being said, Cramer would “rather see you out of Intel and into Hewlett-Packard.” Pfizer : “Pfizer doesn’t have it,” Cramer said. He would swap out of PFE and buy some Schering-Plough . IHOP : It was a buy on the merger with Applebee’s , Cramer said, but now he’d take the gain. “It’s in the wrong group.” Jim’s charitable trust owns Hewlett-Packard.Questions for Cramer?

White House will hire two high-profile aides to run impeachment#As the House impeachment inquiry enters a new, public phase, the White House communications office is expected to add two longtime Trump allies to its staff, where they will be tasked with running a proactive impeachment messaging operation, CNBC confirmed Tuesday.Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, a longtime Trump supporter, and Tony Sayegh, a former Treasury Department spokesman, are both expected to join the White House shortly to work specifically on impeachment related communications, in addition to other special projects as necessary, a senior administration official told CNBC. Bondi and Sayeghs jobs would be temporary,.Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney is very pleased with the Bondi and Sayegh hires, a senior administration official told CNBC. Mulvaney believes they will help round things out as good communicators with strong political skills.The hiring of Bondi and Sayegh, both high-profile political veterans, represents a new, more offensive posture from the White House, which has struggled to devise a cohesive strategy in response to the growing House impeachment inquiry.Trump has so far been resistant to the idea of a special team of staffers who would focus solely on the impeachment, reportedly because he was concerned such an approach was passe in the age of Twitter and social media.Heres the thing: I dont have teams, Trump told reporters at the White House recently. Everyone is talking about teams. Im the team. I did nothing wrong.The choices of Bondi and Sayegh come as little surprise to those in Trumps inner circle. Bondis term as attorney general in Florida ended earlier this year, and in the ensuing months, her name has come up repeatedly as a potential Trump hire, either at the Justice Department or the White House.Bondi made headlines during Trumps presidential campaign for accepting a $25,000 contribution to her political action committee from the Donald J. Trump Foundation, an apparent violation of rules prohibiting donations from nonprofits to PACs.The money was donated in 2013, when the Florida Attorney Generals office was considering whether to join a lawsuit against Trumps now-defunct Trump University. The donation came a few days after Bondi announced that Florida might join the suit. Bondi ultimately decided the state would not take part in the lawsuit.Sayegh is a well-known Republican communications guru, having worked on several high-profile races and most recently as the most visible frontman for the GOPs 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Trumps massive tax reform package. Within the White House, Sayegh is considered an ally of Jared Kushner, Trumps son-in-law and senior advisor.Politico recently reported that Sayeghs potential hiring had set off a turf war inside the West Wing, with some factions strongly backing the choice and others fearful it would give Kushner and his allies too much power over the impeachment communications strategy.— CNBCs Eamon Javers contributed to this report.
Better Than Ramen Noodles#Add American Italian Pasta to Cramer’s list of trade-down plays. The company’s a leader in both the private-label and brand-name markets, he said, and the stock “has the potential to explode higher.”
Dow Closes Up After 700-Point Swing#A late-day rally gave the Dow industrials a triple-digit boost after a volatile session in which the blue-chip index swung within a 700-point range.I think this is bargain hunting and there are some bargains out there. Some of these stocks are at historic lows, Warren Simpson, managing director at Stephens Capital Management in Little Rock, Ark., told Reuters.Traders said another cause for the days wild swings was unwinding of hedged options on the S&P 500 ahead of October options expirations on Friday. The expirations triggered several big buys at the end of the day.The day was book-ended with rallies. Stocks lurched out of the gate following some not-horrible economic reports: Consumer prices came in flatwhile weekly jobless claims fell. But that rally fizzled after mid-morning reports showed the Philadelphia Feds index of mid-Atlantic factory activity fell much more than expected and industrial output hit a nearly 34-year low. The Dow Jones Industrial Average retested Fridays closing low around 8450, then fell through to a five-and-a-half year low. Looking at inflation right now is like looking in the rearview mirror while ignoring the train wreck dead ahead, said Chris Rupkey, an economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.

Saudi Aramco says full oil production capacity will return by#DUBAI ⁠— Saudi Arabias full oil production capacity will be recovered by the end of November, Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser told CNBC on Wednesday.By September we will be, in terms of production capacity, at 11.3 (million barrels per day), by end of November we will be at 12 million barrels per day (bdp), which is our maximum sustained capacity, Nasser told CNBCs Steve Sedgwick during the Oil & Money Conference in London. Saudi Arabia is the worlds largest exporter of oil.The OPEC kingpin has been pumping significantly below that 12 million bpd level as part of a coordinated agreement OPEC and non-OPEC producers to lower output and keep a floor under falling oil prices.Aramcos revenues were not reduced in the wake of the attacks, Nasser noted, and put its October production figure at 9.9 million bpd.The CEO of the worlds largest oil company expressed his concern over an absence of international resolve against the perpetrators of September 14 drone and missile attacks on Aramco facilities that forced the company to shut down half of its production and sent crude prices up nearly 20%.An absence of international resolve to take concrete action may embolden the attackers and indeed put the worlds energy security at greater risk, Nasser said.
Donald Trump Tells Final 2016 Rally: This Is Our Independence#GRAND RAPIDS, Michigan — The Trump Trains final stop was  not a heartfelt appeal to voters in a crucial state on the GOP  nominees path to the White House.  Instead, it was a winding road of his greatest hits — the  same riffs that earned him notoriety through the primaries and  were pillars of his general election message, despite the efforts  of advisers.  Assuming the stage for his fifth appearance of the day, Trump  seemed worn but kept his usual confidence including the classic  call-and-response: Whos going to pay for the wall? MEXICO!More from NBC News:Chance the Rapper Leads Voters on Parade  to the PollsAs Election Day Arrives, Plenty of Blame  to Go AroundTrump on Clintons Celebs: We Dont Need  Lady GagaTrump declared Tuesday our Independence Day and looked forward  to closing the history books on the Clintons and their lies and  schemes and corruption.  We are hours away from a once in a lifetime change, he said.

Billionaire Warren Buffett: This $100 college course gave me the#To say that Warren Buffett is a wealth of wisdom is an understatement.A few years ago, I got the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to interview him for my book, Getting There: A Book of Mentors, which features essays and interviews from the some of the worlds most successful people, as well as their indispensable career and life lessons.In getting to know The Oracle of Omaha, I learned something incredibly surprising: Up until the age of 20, he had a fear of public speaking. Just the thought of it made me physically ill, the billionaire shares in his Getting There essay. I would literally throw up.Who would have thought that one of the most successful investors in the world once had a fear of public speaking?The Berkshire Hathaway CEO divulges that he purposely selected courses in college where he didnt have to stand up in front of the class and arranged his life so that he would never find himself in front of a crowd. If he somehow found himself in that situation, he admits that he could hardly even say his own name.During Buffetts time at Columbia Business School, he saw an ad in the paper for a Dale Carnegie public speaking course for college students. I figured it would serve me well, he recalls. I went to Midtown, signed up and gave them a check. But after I left, I swiftly stopped payment. I just couldnt do it. I was that terrified.After he graduated, Buffett returned to Omaha and got a job as a salesman of securities. But the problem still lingered: I knew that I had to be able to speak in front of people, he writes. So again, I saw the ad in the paper and went down to sign up; but this time, I handed the instructor $100 in cash. I knew if I gave him the cash Id show up.And he did show up.

SnapChat Sees Big Future in Erasable Media#The photo-messaging app SnapChat is just getting started in  erasable media, the company CEO Evan Spiegel said Monday on  CNBCs Squawk on the Street.   We really think this is a big idea...its just the very, very  beginning of something we call ephemeral media, media you share  that disappears. So its hard to say right now, but its a really  big space and we look forward to exploring  it, Spiegel said.   For only being in the beginning stages, SnapChat certainly has a  large base of users.
Your Amazon Echo can now guard your home and listen#Amazon on Tuesday began rolling out Alexa Guard to all Echo devices, including older models that didnt originally get the feature when it was launched late last year.Alexa Guard automatically listens for things like breaking glass and can alert you if it suspects someone is breaking into your home. If you have an ADT or Ring alarm system, it can also automatically set off the alarm. The feature was announced during Amazons big Alexa event last September.Alexa Guard is free but still needs to be manually activated by you. It requires you to first speak Alexa, Im leaving to activate Guard on your Echo and to force Alexa to begin listening for more than just the Alexa wake word.If an Echo hears a window break, it can send you an alert to your phone along with a live video feed if you have an Echo with a camera on it, like the Echo Show. An alert includes a 10-second audio recording of the glass breaking and anything else the Echo heard, but it otherwise doesnt listen unless you speak Alexa again.It will also send alerts if a smart smoke alarm or carbon monoxide alarm goes off. If you configure it, Guard can also automatically turn on smart lights at certain times while youre away, and it will automatically turn them on and off on a schedule as if youre home.Alexa uses machine learning to determine the right lighting activity for your home based on lighting usage across customers, Amazon said.Amazon said it hired licensed contractors to break real glass in a testing lab, to help prevent false positives and to detect the actual sound of breaking glass. This team broke hundreds of different windows, in different sizes, including single pane and double pane, with a variety of instruments including crow bars, hammers, bricks, baseball bats, and more, the company explained in an email to CNBC.If you subscribe to ADT or use Amazons Ring alarm system, Guard can automatically send alerts to professionals so that authorities arrive if a break-in is detected. If you dont have these systems, Alexa Guard wont call the police, itll just notify you of a potential break-in.Heres how to set it up:Now just speak Alexa, Im leaving to activate Guard when you leave the house.
Uber Funding Talks Highlight the Speedy Pace of Investments#Uber raised a total of more than $2 billion from investors in  June and December last year — and is now back for another  round. The anonymous messaging start-up Yik Yak collected $73.5  million in three financing rounds in seven months, and Zenefits,  a human resources start-up, raised more than $580 million in less  than two years, with the latest deal done last week.  The pace of technological change has long been happening at the  lightning-fast speed of the Internet. Now, start-up financing is  increasingly taking place at that speed as well.Read MoreUbers valuation may top $50B with new funding: WSJ  Uber is just one example of the quickening tempo. The  ride-hailing company is in discussions to raise around $1.5  billion in financing, which could value it at $50 billion. Just five months ago the company  collected$1.2 billion for its war chest, an amount that  later swelled with the addition of a strategic investor. And the rate of fund-raising by Uber — and across the  start-up landscape — has little precedent, driven by money  pouring in from hedge funds, strategic investors and more, and by  the willingness of entrepreneurs to embrace the cash.
Wealthy investors expect to earn average annual returns of 17.5%—heres#Wealthy Americans are pretty optimistic about their long-term investment returns, expecting to earn average annual returns of 17.5% above inflation from their portfolios.Thats according to a new survey from Natixis that surveyed households that have over $100,000 in investable assets in March and April of 2021. Those same investors report they expect to earn 17.3% above inflation in 2021, which, while high, may be understandable. The S&P 500 price index returned 15.76% last year and the market was up 5.24% already when the survey was fielded.But longer term, earning an annual return that averages out to 17.5% above inflation year after year is an exceptionally high expectation, says Dave Goodsell, executive director of the Natixis Center for Investor Insight. These estimates are much higher than historical averages. For instance, U.S. stocks average 10-year returns of 9.2%, according to Goldman Sachs data.Financial advisors estimates are also much lower. Advisors surveyed by Natixis are calling for more realistic expectations of 6.7% average annual returns above inflation. In fact, the gap between investors expectations and advisors predictions has been widening dramatically over the years.

Pending home sales fell 2.5 pct in January#The winter wallop may have chilled housing activity in some parts  of the country, but overheated home prices are really what are  slowing sales nationwide.  Home buyers signed 2.5 percent fewer contracts in January to buy  existing homes compared to December. The expectation had been for  a slight gain. The so-called pending home sales index from the  National Association of Realtors, an indicator of future closed  sales, is now just 1.4 percent  higher than it was in  January of 2015. Pending sales have been higher annually for 17  straight months, but this is the second smallest gain in that  time.
Will the US Debt Ceiling be Raised by Aug 2?#Republicans and Democrats have until August 2nd to reach a deal on raising the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling. The Senate canceled its planned July 4 recess and lawmakers are racing against the clock to avert a debt default. Lawmakers have been unable to reach a consensus, with Republicans and Democrats sharply divided over spending cuts and tax hikes. Republicans want Democrats to agree to $2 trillion in spending cuts and not to hike taxes. Theyve walked out on talks led by Vice President Joe Biden. Meanwhile Democrats are looking at a scaled-back deal, which would raise the debt ceiling and buy enough time until after the 2012 Presidential election. Some analysts are worried that the game of brinkmanship between the two sides could lead to a default, even if it is for a few hours. Ratings agencies have warned that such a technical default would hurt the U.S.s Triple-A rating.Time is running out and we want to know whether you think theres enough political will for a deal to be done in time.

Wanting Work, but Stuck in Part-Time Purgatory#Bonnie Gray knows there are people out there who are worse off  than she is. After all, at least she has a job.  Its just not a full-time gig.Like many other Americans, she  works part time and its barely enough to pay for food, fuel and  shelter. Millions of Americans were working part time in November  but they would like to have been working full time. These  so-called involuntary part-time workers are an example of some  of the stubborn pockets of weakness that remain in the labor  market even as the jobs picture improves very slowly.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics  reported Friday that nearly 8.2 million people  classified themselves as involuntary part-time workers in  November, meaning that they settled for less work because they  couldnt get more. Thats around double the number of involuntary  part-timers in 2006, before the nation went into recession and  entered a prolonged period of weak recovery.  A separate group of more than 18 million people were working  part-time in November for non-economic reasons, either because  they are in school or they want to spend more time with their  children, for example.  The number of people who are involuntarily underemployed has gone  down since it hit 9 million in the depths of the recession, but  progress has been slow and rocky. A Demand Problem  For people like Gray, 63, improvement cant come soon enough.  Gray, who lives in Cary, Ill., for years worked two jobs: a  full-time administrative job and, for extra money, a part-time  cashier job at a major home retailer. She was laid off from her  full-time position, which paid close to $16 an hour, in January  of 2012.  She was left with a part-time job that pays $12.40 an hour. That  plus some unemployment compensation she receives is barely enough  to cover her mortgage and other expenses. She sometimes relies on  her church for food, and worries what will happen when the  unemployment runs out at the end of the year.  Shes spent nearly a year looking for another receptionist or  administrative position.  Im on the computer, it seems, 24/7. I am networking. Ive  walked out my resume to 83 companies, she said. Shes also taken  classes on how to interview and on invoicing, and she plans to  take another one on PowerPoint.  Shes had many job interviews in the past 12 months, but no  full-time job offer.  Gray said she cant work any more hours as a cashier because a  tumor on her foot makes it difficult to stand for a long  time.  According to her doctor, the mass isnt cancerous, she said, but  she cant afford to have it removed. Her insurance as a part-time  worker wouldnt be enough to cover the procedure and  rehabilitation.  Gray will turn 64 in February, which means she wont qualify for  Medicare for another year. Until then, she said, she needs a job  that offers health insurance.  Shes hoping to avoid dipping into Social Security for as long as  possible because the longer she waits, the more she stands to  collect.  I was actually hoping to hang on until 70, she said.  She may still be in for a tough slog. Heidi Shierholz, a labor  economist with the liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute,  said the basic issue plaguing involuntary part-time workers like  Gray is the same one plaguing the overall labor market: Theres  just not enough demand to compel employers to add to their labor  costs substantially.  Shierholz said she expects involuntary part-time workers to  gradually see improvements but it is a going to take a long  time.  I think by far the dominant reason that we arent seeing  employment in both dimensions — full (time) people or  ramping up hours for workers that already are there — is  just a demand problem, she said.  Once employers have more work that needs to be done, theyll add  more hours for people to do it. Now I Have to Watch Everything  Debbie Fiore doesnt see that happening any time soon at the  small company where she works.  Fiore, who lives in Nottingham, Md., lost her full-time job with  a long-term care company nearly two years ago, and has struggled  for more than a year to find another job.  A friend connected her with a small company that hired and  trained her for an accounts payable and receivable job. She works  about 25 hours a week and makes about half what she used  to.  Fiore, who turns 57 this week, and her husband struggle to pay  their bills. Its not the situation she envisioned they would be  in heading into their golden years.  Were basically living paycheck to paycheck. Were not able to  save anything for the future at this point. Theres hardly any  emergency money if an emergency comes up, she said.  Shes immensely grateful for the job she has, and said she loves  the work. But financial worries weigh heavily on her.  I think my attitude, my demeanor has changed, she said. I used  to be a very carefree, fun person, and now I have to watch  everything.

CNBC Exclusive: CNBC’s Steve Liesman Interviews Treasury Secretary Jack Lew#WHEN: Today, Tuesday, September 13th  WHERE: CNBCs Squawk Box  Following is the unofficial transcript of a CNBC EXCLUSIVE  interview with Treasury Secretary Jack Lew live from the CNBC  Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha conference in New York  City on Tuesday, September 13th.  Following are links to the video of the interview on  CNBC.com:http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000550691, http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000550692 and http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000550696.  Additional clips are available at CNBC.com.  Mandatory credit: CNBC Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha  conference.  TYLER MATHISEN: Thank you, Mark. So this is Delivering Alpha  Number 6. Were going to start using Roman numerals, so its VI.  Weve had the privilege on five of -- this will be the fifth time  -- save one of our Delivering Alphas, each time weve had the  privilege of Treasury Secretary of the United States being with  us, back to Mr. Geithners term and now, for the third time, the  76th Treasury Secretary of the United States, please welcome to  the stage, Jacob Lew and his interviewer, Steve Liesman, chief  economics correspondent for CNBC. Got to get the title right.  STEVE LIESMAN: Mr. Secretary, thank you for continuing this  tradition of kicking off Delivering Alpha with us.  JACOB LEW: Great to be with you this morning.  STEVE LIESMAN: Am I right that you were just a little late  because you were meeting with the lyricist for the musical thats  going to be made with your tenureship? Is that right?  JACOB LEW: Just like every other New Yorker, I was stuck in  traffic.  STEVE LIESMAN: Will it be rap?  I want to start off with some of the headlines. I mean, its been  a series of headlines from your brief, so to speak, over the last  several days.  This morning theres a story that an executive who oversaw some  of the places where there was alleged phony accounts created at  Wells Fargo made $125 million. Do you feel this is money that  should be clawed back or there should be systems in place to claw  this money back?  JACOB LEW: The consumer protection agency that took action  against Wells Fargo is an important new addition to our  protections for individuals and for the financial system. It  didnt exist before financial reform. I think they uncovered  practices that they have taken action against. I dont comment on  specific regulatory matters. But what I can tell you is what Ive  seen from what theyve done is bad behavior they were correct to  take action against. And how that flows through in terms of next  consequences is going to depend on the facts of the case.  What I can tell you is theres a lot of talk in Washington these  days about rolling back Dodd-Frank, about rolling back the law,  changing the law that created the agency that uncovered and took  action against this. This ought to be a moment when people stop  and remember how dangerous the system is when you dont have the  proper protections in place.  This is something that our watchdogs found. If they were not  there, they would still be going on. This is a wake-up call. It  should remind all of us, and firms, that culture and compensation  make a difference. How you reward people, how you motivate  people, and what values you hold people to matter.  Theres a public responsibility, and I think the CFCB took action  reflecting the public responsibility, and theres a private  responsibility. And we each have to do our part.  STEVE LIESMAN: But if culture and compensation make a difference,  then why wouldnt you support a clawback of this?  JACOB LEW: Im not commenting one way or the other on the  clawback. I really am not going to comment on the facts of the  specific case. Its being reviewed by an independent regulator.  It wouldnt be appropriate for me to speculate on something that  I dont know all the facts of. I think Im addressing the issue  in a pretty conclusive way. This is unacceptable behavior. And  its the kind of behavior that we need to be able to catch and  stop.  STEVE LIESMAN: Weve had billions of dollars of fines levied on  financial institutions. And still this behavior is still being  uncovered. Is Justice going far enough here? Do we need to be in  a situation where, for example, companies are not allowed to  plead that they didnt commit the alleged act and that there are  individual indictments brought? We havent seen that in any of  these financial crimes, or very few of them.  JACOB LEW: We have, I think, taken action on a pretty dramatic  basis to put fines, penalties in place for firms that have acted  badly. The question of whether or not to pursue criminal  prosecution is a decision that prosecutors ultimately make. We  have made clear we dont believe that anyone is too big to jail.  Its up to prosecutors to decide how you pursue the criminal  charges. Its not up to regulators or the policymakers.  What I can say is that the pattern of behavior that weve seen  here is something that needs to stop. It is not acceptable to do  things that are designed to increase either an individual or a  firm bottom line by deceiving consumers and passing along charges  that are either invisible or they dont know about.  And this is not the same as a financial crisis issue. This is  really a consumer protection issue. I dont think this is a  moment where we have to ask the kinds of questions that we did in  2008 about what it means about the underpinnings of the financial  system. But when I hear people say we want to roll back the  statute that created the consumer protection bureau, this is yet  another proof point that it was the right thing to create, its  the right thing to have an independent director, and its the  right thing to make sure that theres somebody, and an entity  watching over our system, to make sure that individuals get clear  information about their financial products and, when firms or  individuals behave badly, that somebody finds out about it and  takes action.  STEVE LIESMAN: Moving to another company story which is in the  headlines, and youre doing specifically with this issue of  Apple, an attempt by the European Union to get 14 1/2 billion  dollars of back taxes.  Beyond the company-specific story, is this an attempt by the E.U.  to essentially grab unpaid American taxes?  JACOB LEW: You know, Steve, I have an op-ed this morning in the  Wall Street Journal where I went into some length describing  our views on this. But let me briefly reprieve what Ive said on  this. We have for some time told the European Commission that we  believe that this is an inappropriate approach. Why is it  inappropriate? We agree with them that its wrong for companies  to avoid paying their fair share of taxes to get to zero or very  low tax rates by taking advantage of tax havens.  But the action that the European Commission took is out of the  framework of normal tax policy, a retroactive tax that reaches  into another country, another jurisdictions tax base, in order  to make sure that a firm pays its taxes. We agree with them that  firms should pay their taxes. But when its U.S. income, we think  that that tax should be paid in the United States.  Weve done a lot of work over the last two years to work on an  international basis to make sure that -- to share information  better. And we have an ability to close several loopholes that  have contributed to the erosion of tax bases around the world. We  need to take action in the United States to decisively change and  pushing firms to take their income overseas. We have a broken  corporate tax code.  We have the highest statutory tax rate in the developed world.  Its riddled with deductions and loopholes that give advantages  that we dont really need or would design for for todays  economy. And the result is we see U.S. companies trying to impart  income in lower tax jurisdictions.  Now, those lower tax jurisdictions are for doing some things that  arent right also. The race to the bottom with low tax rates to  be a magnet for those companies, that has to change too.  But what action do we need to take in the United States? We need  to fix our tax system. We need to close the loopholes. We need to  lower the statutory tax rate. And one of the things that weve  proposed, which I believe is an idea that will still have  resonance in the year to come is that the revenue that we get by  putting a one-time tax on income thats parked overseas will  produce one-time revenue that ought to be used to fund an  investment in infrastructure in this country.  So we can do two things at the same time. We can fix a broken tax  code. We can make it so that our companies dont feel they have  to leave the United States to put their income overseas. And we  can fix our broken infrastructure.  What I dont think is right is for tax authorities and other  jurisdictions to reach into our tax base and to remove the  ability for us to execute what I just described.  STEVE LIESMAN: So if theyre reaching in on Apple, are there  other company cases yet to come?  JACOB LEW: There are a number of pending matters --  STEVE LIESMAN: Pending, but what about ones that you think  theres going to be more of a grab at this point?  JACOB LEW: I cant speak to the European Commission, but we have  spoken on the policy. We dont address individual cases. As I  mentioned before, Im not addressing the individual case that  they choose to act on.  STEVE LIESMAN: So does that mean you wont join as a party to the  case in Europe, to join as an amicus, so to speak?  JACOB LEW: Well, the European procedure is a little bit different  than ours. They are very aware of our views. Weve submitted our  views in a pretty formal way. The parties here are the government  involved and the company involved. Theyve both indicated their  intention to appeal. And weve made our views known to the  authorities in Europe. And weve done it in a way that our views  will be before the commission on future matters as well.  STEVE LIESMAN: Lets talk about the tax rate, the right corporate  tax rate. 35% is the current top rate, just the federal part.  Theres another six points or so according to the OECD that would  be added on some level. You proposed 28. It seems like the House  Republicans wanted 25, and Donald Trump wants 15.  15 would be toward the lower end of the OECD. 12 1/2 is Ireland.  Germany is around 15. Why wouldnt we want a rate that low that  would make America very competitive?  JACOB LEW: The principle thats driven our work on tax reform is  that it has to be revenue neutral. We are -- I dont think -- it  would not be right for us to have individuals pay more taxes for  us to lower the corporate tax rate.  What weve proposed doing is eliminating loopholes and deductions  and using the revenues that we get by doing that to reduce the  tax rate on the business side as much as we can. We got to 28%  essentially because that was the amount of loopholes that we  could close.  STEVE LIESMAN: I get what youre saying, and that makes perfect  sense on one side of the ledger. But the other side of the  ledger, at 28, youre still not competitive and theres still a  13-point incentive for companies to go overseas.  JACOB LEW: In the 25-28% range, were getting pretty close to the  average. And a few minutes ago, I talked about the race to the  bottom. Some of the pressures on countries that cut their tax  rates to low rates in order to be a magnet, if we, as we have  discussed in the G20 and the OECD and other international bodies,  truly believe that we need to close down the pathways to tax  avoidance, were going to need to conform to some norms. And  having countries go to very low tax rates is part of the problem.  We have our problem. We have a very high rate and a broken  system. We need to fix our system and take a look at theirs as  well.  STEVE LIESMAN: Is this a failure of the administration for  corporate tax reform here?  JACOB LEW: I actually think that if you look at the history of  tax reform, it often takes many years for it to kind of take  hold. And its not unusual for it to begin in one administration  and finish in another. I feel weve made actually a great deal of  progress working through bipartisan conversations to build a  growing consensus around the kind of approach that Ive  described.  I think that theres an environment now where the political  environment is not one where it has been ripe to take up  something like this. But the ideas that weve been promoting will  be the foundation for action in the future.  So I actually feel weve moved significantly toward tax reform.  You know, it takes a desire on the part of Congress to do  something hard. Hard things dont happen unless theres a real,  real desire to do it. And you need a partner. We have had  individual partners, but, as a whole, we have not had that  commitment.  STEVE LIESMAN: But if you look at this issue from outside the  Beltway, one guy is at 28, the other guy is at 25. Lets get in  the room, spend 7 minutes, and well make a deal. It seems like  you were impossibly close almost the entire time and didnt make  it down there.  JACOB LEW: You and I have discussed this a number of times,  Steve.  STEVE LIESMAN: And I still dont have a good -- not from you, but  in general.  JACOB LEW: I do believe that the people that weve engaged with,  who have been leaders on the Republican side, now Speaker Paul  Ryan, some senators who have been engaged in it, weve had a lot  of conversations that lead me to believe there is the basis for  an agreement. I just think the time for that agreement is  probably not the next four months.  STEVE LIESMAN: Do you look back --  JACOB LEW: In terms of need to do it, you look at the  infrastructure component of this, I think theres an urgency  right now to dealing with infrastructure. You look at the action  taken by the European Commission, thats an urgency that we need  to act if we want to protect our tax base.  You have an alignment of forces right now that I think create a  real opportunity. And I certainly think thats an opportunity the  American people would be well served if Congress takes advantage  of.  STEVE LIESMAN: Lets talk about the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  Again, thats another program or effort by the administration,  worked hard on it, seemed to get agreement, and now cant get it  through Congress. Do you regret that? Is that a failure of the  administration?  JACOB LEW: Well, first, I wouldnt draw conclusions about what we  can and cant get through.  STEVE LIESMAN: Im watching my clock here.  JACOB LEW: Theres still time for the TPP, Trans-Pacific  Partnership, to be approved.  Lets start with the substance. TPP is a good economic deal for  the United States. Its good for American workers. And its good  for U.S. security interests in the world. It means that they will  have a more level playing field. American products and services,  which are best in the world, will be able to compete on stronger  ground. And it retains the U.S. leadership in the world on  important strategic issues.  So I think its vitally important that we get it approved. I  believe theres still support for TPP. Theres clearly opponents  of TPP. I cant question that. Weve passed through the Congress,  about a year ago, the underlying legislation, Trade Promotion  Authority, which provides the procedural basis to approve TPP.  TPA, I believe, was a harder vote than TPP. It was an  abstraction; it wasnt a specific agreement.  I can point in TPP to how it strengthens labor standards, how it  strengthens environmental standards, how it raises business  practices closer to our own. I can point around the world to  countries that are already taking policy actions, whether its  Mexico or Vietnam, to meet some of those standards.  I think we have the substance profoundly on our side. What I  think the challenge we have -- and this is a big challenge. We  can make the case that it will improve growth in the United  States, and more GDP should be good for everyone. Where were  running into a problem right now is the sense that is not just in  the United States, but its in other parts of the world, that  more growth does not necessarily mean better wages or better  opportunity for working people.  I think the issue that is the real issue that were going to have  to deal with is to show how the benefit gets to individuals. And  thats bigger than TPP. I think we saw that in the United Kingdom  in the vote recently on the referendum.  STEVE LIESMAN: And thats a failure at every level of leadership,  when it comes to economic issues, the issue of trade and its  benefits. The support of the American people has eroded almost  across the board.  JACOB LEW: Right. But the point I just made, Steve, is its  broader than trade. I think it gets to the question of a social  compact. I think it gets to the question of how free market  capitalism and liberal democracy thrives. We have to ask some  serious questions about what is it thats holding wages back?  What is it thats preventing individuals from feeling that they  have a share in growth?  I know what we can do at a public policy level. At a public  policy level, talking about infrastructure, and we talk about  skills. If you want to have working people feel that they have a  stake in the future, they have to have the skills to get jobs in  the economy of the future, and they have to have the ability to  get to and from home and work. And they have to see a growing  economy thats going to grow the kinds of jobs that they can take  advantage of. Thats bigger than trade.  I think we have a confluence of things that have been going on  between technology and trade and the changing structure of our  economy that are making it a challenging moment. But TPP on its  face should be a clear plus. And were going to continue to make  that case. And I think were going to have to demonstrate the  commitment to working families.  STEVE LIESMAN: But, I mean, in that equation, you have to address  the omnibus criticism of the Obama administration, which was one  of regulation that tamped down on private enterprise, and too  much government intrusion into the private sector that really  kept some of the gains getting to individuals.  JACOB LEW: I think if you look at where the economy was when we  took office just under eight years ago, it was in the middle of  the greatest recession since the Great Depression. We were seeing  unemployment at 10%. There was no bottom. We put in place an  economic program thats lifted the United States out of that  recession. Weve seen sustained growth. Weve seen 15 million new  jobs. Were seeing wage growth. And some of these things that  youre just labeling regulation are also why were able to be in  a place to meet our commitments to reduce our emissions and to  meet the standards to make this a safer world by having our  climate problems not engulf our future.  Theres a lot of things going on inside the package that you call  just more regulation. This economy is a stronger economy because  of the policies weve pursued. Its not as strong an economy as  we would like to see. A lot of what I see as having held back the  U.S. economy is the headwinds internationally. Weve seen  probably a half a percentage point of GDP shaved off the U.S.  economy because demand globally has been weak.  Thats one of the reasons we put so much time into trying to help  move the global debate towards using more policy tools to grow  demand and grow the economy. And weve made progress there. I  think weve made real progress. You are seeing a number of  countries around the world put in place more aggressive policy  using fiscal tools as well as monetary tools.  So I think theres a lot of things going on. And I think right  now the United States is looked to in the world as being a  resilient economy thats bounced back. What I tell my colleagues  around the world is we cant be the only engine in the world  economy. There need to be multiple engines.  STEVE LIESMAN: I want to get to the overall economy. But one of  the things youve talked about is this need to invest in  infrastructure. The Republican nominee has accomplished something  like half a trillion dollars for spending on infrastructure. Do  you think thats a good number?  JACOB LEW: I have to tell you, Steve, I havent dissected any of  the campaign proposals. Im not doing politics in my current  life. Im happy to talk about our policies, but I havent  actually taken apart the campaign proposals.  STEVE LIESMAN: Well, whats the right number for infrastructure  investment? I assume youre talking over a 10-year period.  JACOB LEW: Yeah, the right number is a very, very big one. We  have trillions of dollars that need to be invested. Its not all  public money. What we did a year ago, a little over a year ago,  is we extended our surface transportation funding for five years,  basically at level funding, a little bit of an increase. Enough  to maintain what were doing now, not enough to build the new  facilities that we need to compete in the 21st century.  I think putting several hundred billion dollars of federal money  into a commitment on a multiyear basis to build infrastructure  would have an effect on state and local planning that would bring  more state and local resources to bear and, just as importantly,  would be a foundation for public-private partnerships, which is  what gives you the ability to leverage the amount of resource you  are putting in.  This is not all a question of just federal funding. But federal  funding has been the foundation. One of the things that we do is  we create a kind of certainty out there that theres steady flow  to get projects off the drawing board. Without that, the whole  system slows down. And I think we have taken some time off from  driving that process forward, not to the point that its  irreparable, but we cant take another decade off.  STEVE LIESMAN: At the same time, when we look at overall economic  growth, were doing just around 1% the last three quarters. How  much concern has this caused you that we cant even get to the  new lower new normal of 2%?  JACOB LEW: I think when you go quarter to quarter, sometimes you  can overexplain an individual quarter.  Weve seen growth in the low 2% for a number of years now. Were  continuing to see strong labor markets. Were continuing to see  improvements in wage growth. Consumers in the U.S. are very  strong. Housing is doing better. Autos have been doing very well.  The weak spot on the economic picture is investment. And I think  that if we could figure out what it is thats going on in  investment and productivity to drive the investment numbers  forward, that would be very important. I mean, I think that there  is a lingering lack of confidence in the global economy coming  out of the economic crisis. It was a deep, deep economic crisis.  It left concern. How do you know were not snapping back?  I think in the United States weve demonstrated pretty decisively  that were not slipping back. There are other parts of the world  where every three to six months you wonder, is it going one way  or the other? Theres a lot of geopolitical risks. I think we  have to stabilize those risks.  One of the things we do when we meet in the G20 is focus on that.  And just last week we met in China at the G20 leaders meeting.  And I think you heard a few things at that meeting that were  important and different.  One is what I just talked about in terms of inclusive growth, in  terms of everybody sharing in it. We used to be a chorus of maybe  one talking about inclusive growth. All the leaders were talking  about inclusive growth. I think theres a clear understanding  that we have to show that the benefits of growth get to working  people globally right now.  Secondly, there was a commitment to using all policy tools that  is much stronger than its been in the past, where heads of state  are talking about using the fiscal space they have more  vigorously. And I think on the exchange rate issues that have  been so vexing for a long time, we have a clear agreement to  refrain from competitive devaluation and to coordinate together  so that, at moments of volatility, we dont see unilateral  actions that destabilize the global economy.  STEVE LIESMAN: I just want to come back to one of the things you  just talked about, which is using the fiscal side.  Is the fiscal side getting a message from the monetary side that  theres only so far theyre willing to go? Mario Draghi last week  suggested, you know, were at a negative place. We dont want to  go more negative. Possibility of the feds discussing raising  interest rates. Is the fiscal side getting a new message from the  monetary side?  JACOB LEW: As you know, Steve, I dont comment on monetary  policy, particularly not fed policy.  STEVE LIESMAN: Were talking about fiscal policy.  JACOB LEW: I dont think that fiscal authorities needed messages  from anyone that the fiscal tools are important. Weve been  delivering that message consistently since 2009. Ive been doing  it as treasury secretary for the last three and a half years.  What weve seen over the last three years is a shift in the  debate.  When I became treasury secretary, there was a global debate about  austerity versus growth. We went to G7 and G20 meetings and there  would be debates about austerity versus growth. Those debates are  over. There is no more focus on austerity qua austerity. There is  a focus on making sure there are sustainable fiscal plans, but in  terms of short-term programs, the global community has embraced  the idea that we need to use all policy tools.  Now, if you look around the world, even in the last six months,  youve seen from China to Canada, from South Korea to Japan, more  use of fiscal tools in a responsible way. It doesnt mean build  up debt thats unsustainable. But it does mean dont try to hit  deficit targets and debt targets in the short term when you need  to get your economic engine moving.  I think fiscal authorities during this recession put more  pressure on monetary authorities than they should have. Ive said  that all along. Here in the United States, we went too fast in  the terms of some of the fiscal consolidation. There was a big  debate in the United States in 2011 and 2012 about this. Weve  done okay. We could have done better. We could have had a little  more growth if we had put some of the savings a few years out and  less of the savings in the front end. Other countries didnt do  as much as we did. They didnt have the recovery. They didnt do  a payroll tax. You know they didnt come back repeatedly and put  more fiscal power to deal with economies that needed it.  It wasnt always pretty in the United States, but we used all of  our policy tools. Our fed was aggressive, our fiscal program was  big, and our reform to the financial system was a structural  reform that we needed here in the United States.  There are still challenges in the future, but our call  internationally is for all the tools to be used.  STEVE LIESMAN: I want to talk about the challenges in the future.  Could you give us an idea -- maybe youve thought about this.  What goes in the letter that you leave for your successor?  JACOB LEW: Well, this may surprise you, Steve, but thats  something you think about when you get to the last day, in my  experience. You dont write it four months in advance.  I think that were still focused on the work we have to finish in  these next four months. I think that the economy that we are  working through now and that we will leave behind is much, much  stronger in almost every dimension than the economy we inherited.  Im proud of that. Thats something the American people are well  served by.  That doesnt mean that all of the challenges of the future are  addressed. I think these questions of income inequality are deep  economic and social issues. And weve put proposals forward that  we believe deal with that in a sensible way to pay for things  like education, starting with preschool, community college  education, and pay for infrastructure and to have an equitable  distribution of tax burden to pay for it. Those debates arent  over.  I think that if we take a long break from dealing with all of  those issues, we pay a price. It starts to stress both the  economy and the social fabric.  I think weve done enormously important work. I dont think any  administration finishes the job. You pass the baton, and you give  some advice, and then you try from the sidelines to help move  things in the right direction.  STEVE LIESMAN: So I wonder if, four months in advance, you think  about what youd do personally. Have you thought about going back  to Wall Street or academia? What have you thought about?  JACOB LEW: I have made one key decision: To live in the same city  as my wife for the next four years.  STEVE LIESMAN: Im looking forward to Lew the Musical. And thank  you very much for joining us.  JACOB LEW: Thanks, Steve.

Ukraine-Russia prisoner swap is opportunity to resolve crisis: French minister#Frances foreign minister said on Sunday a prisoner swap between Ukraine and Russia was an opportunity to find a solution to the crisis.There is an opportunity, a door opened to start making progress towards settling this conflict, Le Drian told Europe 1 radio,Russia and Ukraine swapped dozens of prisoners on Saturday in a carefully-negotiated rapprochement that brought Western praise and could thaw a freeze in relations since Moscows annexation of the Crimea region in 2014.
Starbucks espresso goes blonde to lure in new coffee drinkers#Starbucks coffee isnt the only menu item to go blonde.The coffee giant is now offering blonde espresso at all U.S. locations, marking the first time the company has given its consumers a chance to pick the espresso in their cup.This new espresso, made with beans from Latin America, packs 10 more milligrams of caffeine per shot and has a distinctively crisp, citrus flavor and a creamy texture.The company said it hopes offering customers a little more choice will make espresso more approachable to new coffee drinkers. This gateway espresso will be a permanent fixture on Starbucks menu for the same price as Starbucks Signature espresso shot.The company introduced blonde espresso in Canada before testing it in Austin, Texas, and Tampa, Florida. Starbucks said that it was well-received by customers and its baristas.Starbucks has worked hard to define itself as a go-to premium coffee destination, especially with its newer Roastery and Reserve Bar locations. Adding blonde espresso allows the company to appeal to consumers who havent acquired a taste for strong and bold coffee flavors. Because of this, Starbucks said that it isnt worried about sales cannibalization.This product launch, which started Tuesday, comes at a time when Starbucks is faced with increasing competition from coffee companies like Dunkin Donuts, which has increased its number and variety of premium coffee items, and even fast-food chains like McDonalds, which has gained a foothold in the market with its $2 McCafe drinks.Starbucks is also under pressure to revitalize its U.S. sales growth. In November, Starbucks reset its long-term financial targets, and now expects global same-store sales growth of 3 percent to 5 percent, down from a prior goal of mid-single digit growth.
What you should do if you or someone you know#High-profile breakthrough Covid cases, from an aide to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to U.S. gymnast Kara Eaker to several Yankees, are raising questions about what a positive test means for those who are fully vaccinated.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention only counts breakthrough cases that lead to hospitalizations and deaths: Since July 12, its documented 5,492 such patients (the majority of whom are over the age of 65) out of the more than 160 million people in the U.S. who have been fully vaccinated.Still, breakthrough cases are not something to ignore, especially with the more transmissible and dangerous delta variant now accounting for 83% of all sequenced Covid cases in the U.S.We are concerned that we are seeing more so-called breakthrough infections, Dr. Anthony Fauci, White House chief medical advisor told CNBCs Sara Eisen on Closing Bell Wednesday. Thats something we obviously dont want to see were dealing with a highly transmissible virus.Thats because any case of Covid can continue the spread of Covid and its variants, says Dr. Iahn Gonsenhauser, chief quality and patient safety officer at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center.If youre vaccinated and have a breakthrough positive case, you want to limit your exposure to others so that we can limit the capacity that the viral variants have both to spread and to continue to mutate, Gonsenhauser says.Heres what you need to know:
Lower Output, Higher Costs Hit Statoil Operating Profit#Norways StatoilHydro said currency gains boosted its third-quarter net profit, but lower oil and gas output and higher costs hit operating results and made the $110 billion group cautious on 2007 production targets.Output fell 2 percent year-on-year to just over 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, a touch below forecasts and echoing industry trends seen at both Shell and BP, where production fell 4 percent.Shares in StatoilHydro rose 1.6 percent to 185.7 crowns after a slow start to outpace the DJ Stoxx Oil and Gas Index, up 1.2 percent on the back of record oil prices.Earnings before interest and tax fell to 24.4 billion crowns ($4.54 billion) in July-September from 30.2 billion a year ago, worse than all forecasts by 18 analysts in a Reuters poll, which ranged from 24.8 billion to 30.3 billion crowns.The decrease is mainly caused by lower downstream results, a 15 percent decrease in gas prices, as well as higher operational costs and exploration activity, Chief Executive Helge Lund told a news conference on Monday.Net profit rose 26 percent to 10.7 billion crowns, beating an average forecast of 9.9 billion in the Reuters survey, mainly due to an increase in net financial items from currency gains, StatoilHydro said.The third-quarter results are the last without the oil and gas assets of industrial group Norsk Hydro, which Statoil officially took over on Oct. 1 to become StatoilHydro.The numbers were worse than expected, and adjusted for one-off effects, they were even worse, said analyst Martin Moelsaeter at First Securities.Foggy GuidanceLund said he expected Statoils production to be at the lower end of its 2007 target of 1.15-1.2 million boed, but offered little vision for beyond this year.The group will give figures including output from the acquired Norsk Hydro assets on Nov. 12, and its production targets for 2008 are due out early next year.Mark Bloomfield, analyst at Citigroup Global Markets, said StatoilHydro did not have a confidence-building quarter in terms of production, but he expected combined StatoilHydro production to grow by 8 percent in 2008.(StatoilHydros investment) story may be hurt by near-term uncertainty over volume guidance, but this is presently outweighed by $90 a barrel plus oil price, Bloomfield said.StatoilHydro remains our top pick (in Europes integrated oil and gas segment), reflecting attractive fundamental valuation and a 10 percent ... discount to the peer group.StatoilHydros oil and gas production in the third quarter fell to 1.056 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, below the 1.08 million boed average forecast. Its production costs per barrel rose to 31.3 crowns for the 12 months ended Sept. 30, from 26.2 crowns for all of 2006.Russian HopesLast week StatoilHydro agreed with Russias Gazprom to become a partner in the giant Shtokman gas field in the Russian part of the Barents Sea.Lund said costs stemming from the deal will come later. We have not paid one crown at this stage, Lund told Reuters, rejecting Russian newspaper reports that his group had paid hundreds of millions to participate in the project.StatoilHydro has said project expenses are limited initially to the costs of planning and studies, until a final investment decision is made, probably in the second half of 2009.In a research note on Friday, HSBC said if the Shtokman deal went ahead it could be worth an additional 2.5-5 crowns per StatoilHydro share.StatoilHydro gets 24 percent of the company that will develop the Arctic field, by far the biggest in Europe, and will probably be able to book reserves from it despite not being a direct owner of the field. It joins Frances Total as a second western partner in Shtokman.Shares in StatoilHydro have surged by 22 percent since mid-August lows, outpacing an 18 percent rise by the DJ Stoxx Oil and Gas Index. According to Reuters Knowledge, StatoilHydro trades at around 11.5 times forecast 2008 earnings, below the 12.9 times average in the Integrated Oil and Gas sector.

Put blind spots in the rearview with this high-tech car#The engineers at Cadillac say theyve found the key to further eliminating a drivers blind spot.   Starting with its newest model, the 2016 CT6, the automaker will  incorporate streaming video into the vehicles rearview mirror, which will  be fed by a high-definition camera embedded in the center of the  trunk.  The technology will give CT6 drivers an immediate view of whats  behind them in all lanes, and improve their field of vision by  300 percent, according to Cadillac. Read MoreBig 3 dominance slips amid  competition  The closest comparison to this kind of rear vision would be  driving a convertible with the top down, said Travis Hester, the  vehicles executive chief engineer.
Teva & Barr Get Super-Sized#Israels Teva Pharmaceuticals, the biggest generic drug company in the world, in what became one of the worlds worst-kept secrets this week is buying the American Barr Pharmaceuticals.The price is $66.50 a share, which really isnt much a premium based on Thursdays closing price. But its a huge markup from where BRLsstock was sitting earlier this week before the rumors and media reports started swirling about a deal being in the works. Barrs Chairman and CEO Bruce Downey told me Tevas CEO Schlomo Yanai made the first move. But it didnt happen in a long-distance phone call from Tel Aviv to New Jersey. They say they were at an industry conference in Palm Beach outside some burger joint when the subject came up. On the conference call this morning during the question and answer period, one analyst (Id like to give him credit for his sense of humor, but I cant remember who it was and because Im under deadline I dont have time to go back and listen to the replay) joked to Mr. Downey, You got reimbursed for lunch in this deal. The CEO shot back, And I can afford the next one, too. I got to know Mr. Downey when he was fighting to win Food and Drug Administration approval of over-the-counter sales for the somewhat controversial Plan B or so-called Morning After Pill. The social implications of its eventual behind-the-counter approval were much bigger than the financial implications for BRL. But Mr. Downey maintained he personally believed the drug should be more easily accessible and that he was on a mission to make it happen. In the first quarter of this year, BRL took in nearly 600 million bucks. Less than a hundred million of that was from a number of proprietary products, which includes Plan B. He also volunteered during his interview with me on CNBC this morning that during his tenure hed been approached 12 times about doing a deal like this one. A dozen offers! Wow. Both Downey and Yanai said they think the generic drug sector will continue to consolidate. Among the American players still out there are Mylan Labs,Watson Pharmaceuticalsand King Pharmaceuticals, just to name a few.
Gold steadies after hitting 5-month peak as political tensions simmer#Gold steadied on Wednesday after hitting a five-month peak as political tensions simmered, leaving investor interest in safe havens like the precious metal largely intact.Tarnishing an otherwise brightening outlook for global growth, tensions continued to boil in the Korean peninsula and the Middle East, while worries over the upcoming French presidential election persisted.Spot gold inched down 0.11 percent to $1,272.71 per ounce after hitting its strongest since Nov. 10 at 1,279.80 earlier in the session. U.S. gold futures for June delivery rose $3.90 to settle at $1,278.31 after hitting $1,281.80 earlier in the session, the highest level since Nov. 10.The short term geopolitical impact will likely fade but( gold) was oversold on expectations of rate hikes and the reality of muted rate hikes sets up the potential for (further) upside, said Hamza Khan, head of commodities strategy at ING.Gold tends to gain when rate hike expectations recede because lower rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.The dollar was flat versus a currency basket after falling on Tuesday, though a general risk-off mood that has prompted investors to sell the greenback prevailed. Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday stressed the need for a peaceful solution for the Korean peninsula on a call with U.S President Donald Trump.
Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall#Prior to returning to Harvard and the Belfer Center, Sherwood-Randall served as Deputy Secretary at the U.S. Department of Energy from October 10, 2014, to January 20, 2017. In her capacity as Deputy Secretary, she was the departments chief operating officer, overseeing a budget of nearly $30 billion and a workforce of more than 113,000 people.

There won’t be a summer rate hike, so I’ll focus#Despite all signs from Fed Chair Janet Yellen that there will be  an interest rate hike this summer, one trader insists the U.S.  central bank is on hold, and that means good news for the  commodities sector.   Youll notice that after that disastrous 38,000 jobs added [in  May], you saw big moves up in the commodities space and a move  down in the dollar, Todd Gordon of TradingAnalysis.com told  CNBCs Trading Nation on Monday. Thats reflecting the Fed  sitting on the beach on their hands for the summer.  Gordon took a look at the market overall and identified the lead  sectors kicking off the week on Monday. While the S&P 500 is  up, he noted that the leading sectors in the marketplace appear  to be industrials, materials and energy, with oil leading the  way. Crude was up more than one percent midday.   The trend has Gordon willing to bet on the oil and gas production  ETF (XOP) breaking through to new highs. More specifically,  Gordon believes that the XOP is actually set to break above the  $37 mark and has set $36.50 as the key level to watch for in the  next coming days.  If the XOP does move to $36.50, Gordon predicts that oil will  keep moving up.  If we can get up to the $36.50 mark, it looks like XOP, along  with crude oil, should be able to move up through the next  several days, Gordon said.
Dont be shocked by Trumps moves, hes just keeping his#From picking perceived outsiders for Cabinet positions to  calling out certain American companies, nothing Donald Trump has done as president-elect should come as a  surprise, former Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez told CNBC on  Monday.Agree with Trump or not, hes making moves based  on promises he made during the campaign, said Gutierrez, who  headed Commerce for President George W. Bush. [Trump] is behaving like an executive. This is like executive  basics. You have a strategy and you put the right skills in a job  to implement your strategy, Gutierrez, formerly CEO of Kellogg,  said on Squawk Box.For example, he pointed to Trumps decision to chose Tom Price to  head the Health and Human Services Department due to the  Georgia congressmans intimate knowledge of Obamacare and how to  dismantle it.While Price was also a doctor, conventional wisdom might have  pointed to retired neurosurgeon and former GOP rival  Ben Carson for HHS, Gutierrez said. But Carson was selected for  secretary of Housing and Urban Development.Gutierrez also spoke highly of Exxon Mobil Chairman and CEO Rex  Tillerson, whos said to be Trumps choice for secretary of  State. He called unfair aspersions about the oilman being a  friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin just because hes  negotiated business contracts with Moscow.A lot of whats happening, whether its happening in an orderly  fashion or now, are things he ran on, argued Gutierrez, who said  he did not support Trump during the campaign but aims to be  objective.During the campaign, he said hes going to go after companies  that outsource and export back in. Thats what hes doing,  Gutierrez said, referring to the deal Trump helped craft earlier  this month with United Technologies to keep the firms Carrier  unit from closing a plant in Indianapolis.  Trump has also called out other American companies that have big  government contracts. In a Monday morning tweet, Trump took a  swipe at Lockheed Martins F-35 program, saying the cost was out  of control. Last week, Trump tweeted a shot at Boeing,  threatening to cancel its 747 Air Force One program.
Early movers: LO, RAI, PG, AMZN, FAST, GPS & more#Check out which companies are making headlines before the  bell:   Lorillard, Reynolds American–The two U.S.  tobacco companies issued a statement confirming merger talks, and  that they are also talking to Britains Imperial Tobacco about  selling various assets and brands. CNBC had  reported the talks last Friday and that a deal was likely to  emerge within weeks. Imperial also issued a statement  acknowledging the negotiations.  Procter & Gamble–Wells Fargo downgraded the stock  to market perform from outperform, citing a lack of progress  in improvement for P & Gs fundamentals.  Qualcomm–Goldman Sachs removed the chip makers  stock from its conviction buy list, noting that the catalysts  for an improved stock price laid out in a November report have  largely played out.
Small Radiation Found in Washington State Milk: FDA#The Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration say that very low levels of radiation have turned up in a sample of milk from Washington state. But federal officials say consumers should not worry.The FDA said such findings are to be expected in the coming days because of the nuclear crisis in Japan, and that the levels are expected to drop relatively quickly.Results from a March 25 milk sample taken from Spokane, Wash., show levels of radioactive Iodine-131 that are still 5,000 times below levels of concern set by the FDA, including levels set for infants and children.The EPA said it is increasing the level of nationwide monitoring of milk, precipitation and drinking water following the crisis at the Japanese nuclear power plant.
Dollar Down but Pares Losses#The dollar was largely down against other major currencies, although a surprisingly strong rise in new home sales helped the dollar reverse some of its losses.The government reported that new home sales beat expectations and rose 3.4 percent in November to an annual pace of 1.047 million units, which eased concerns about the extent of the housing markets slowdown and tempered expectations that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates early next year to stimulate growth.The new home sales report did beat the consensus forecast, and that, I think, provides further evidence to support the view that the worst of the housing downturn may have passed, said Alex Beuzelin, senior market analyst for Ruesch International in Washington, D.C.With the European Central Bank widely expected to keep raising rates and the Bank of Japan possibly discussing tighter monetary policy at its meeting in January, the dollar slipped as investors returned from the Christmas holiday with more conviction that the U.S. currencys yield advantage will fade next year.Data showing weaker-than-expected Japan retail sales was overshadowed by a media report that the Bank of Japan will probably discuss raising interest rates at next months policy meeting.Currency trading in Asia was disrupted after strong earthquakes near Taiwan damaged undersea telecommunications cables, restricting international telephone traffic and Internet speeds, but trade in the North American markets was not affected.U.S. benchmark Treasury note prices, meanwhile, were off almost a full point on the day at 99 27/32, bringing yields up to 4.64%, taking their lead from a fall in European government bond prices and the stronger housing data.
Los Angeles Port Workers Avert Strike With 11th Hour Deal#Port clerks and their employers at the nations largest port complex tentatively agreed on a new contract Thursday, preventing a strike that could have crippled shipping and cost billions of dollars, a negotiator said.The employers are pleased that the union recognized the substantial investment that (employers) have made and agreed to their last wage proposal, said Steve Berry, a negotiator for the shippers.John Fageaux Jr., president of the union local, said he was satisfied with the tentative agreement.The 15,000-member International Longshore and Warehouse Union had indicated that longshoremen would honor picket lines if the 750 clerical workers went on strike. Such a move would have effectively stopped the loading and unloading of cargo at the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles.If that happened, it could have effectively stopped the loading and unloading of cargo at the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, a complex that accounts for more than 40 percent of all the cargo container traffic coming into the United States.We think its in everyones interest -- the consumers, the city -- that we dont have a work stoppage, Berry said.The Office Clerical Unit, Local 63, of the ILWU represents workers for 17 shipping companies and other cargo firms at the twin ports. Its clerks work at marine terminals and handle bookings for the export of cargo and other transport documents.Their last contract, which expired June 30, gave full-time clerical workers about $37.50 an hour, or $78,000 a year, plus a pension, health care benefits free of premiums, and 20 paid holidays a year.Under the tentative deal reached Thursday, the workers will receive a wage increase of 7 percent over the three-year contract. That includes a 50-cents-per-hour increase in the first year and $1-per-hour increase in each subsequent year. The employers also agreed to pay $3.4 million to establish a trust fund to manage employees health and welfare and pensions plans.Fageaux said he expects the union membership to vote on the tentative deal some time next week.Both sides negotiated hard for their positions, and both sides recognized what the other side needed, he said.
Coronavirus mortgage bailout: There is going to be complete chaos,#A broad coalition of mortgage and finance industry leaders on Saturday sent a plea to federal regulators, asking for desperately needed cash to keep the mortgage system running during the coronavirus pandemic, as requests from borrowers for the federal mortgage forbearance program are pouring in at an alarming rate.The Cares Act, which seeks to limit the economic damage from COVID-19, mandates that all borrowers with government-backed mortgages — about 62% of all first lien mortgages according to Urban Institute — be allowed to delay at least 90 days of monthly payments and possibly up to a years worth.Those payments would then have to be made at a later time through a payment plan. Servicers are granting the payment deferrals to borrowers with no questions asked, as is required by the law, but the servicers still have to pay mortgage bond holders.In normal times, they have enough to cover these payments, and, in fact, at the end of last year the mortgage delinquency rate was near a record low, according to CoreLogic. Now that rate is skyrocketing, and servicers do not have nearly enough cash to cover those payments to bondholders.The coalition, which includes the Mortgage Bankers Association, the National Association of Home Builders, the National Association of Realtors, the Independent Community Bankers of America, U.S. Mortgage Insurers and the National Apartment Association, issued a press release Saturday saying, The scale of this forbearance program could not have been foreseen by mortgage servicers, or fully anticipated by regulators ... it is therefore incumbent upon the government to provide a liquidity facility for single-family and multifamily servicers ... any further delay could lead to greater uncertainty and volatility in the market.
Google bought $750 million Lenovo stake on January 30#Internet search company Google Inc bought a 5.94 percent stake in Chinas Lenovo Group last month for $750 million, according to a disclosure on the Hong Kong stock exchange.Google acquired 618.3 million Lenovo shares at $1.213 per share on Jan. 30, the stock exchange said late on Thursday.Lenovo agreed to buy Googles Motorola handset division last week for $2.91 billion in a cash and stock deal.

Shark Tank: This fighter-jet salesman quit 6-figure job to sell#Patrick Coddou seemed to have an enviable life: A great wife, a great job with an impressive salary. But thats not how he felt. I spent about a decade climbing the corporate ladder. I had a six-figure job. I literally sold stealth-fighter jets for a living, Patrick told the Shark Tank investors on Sundays episode. On the outside, it looked like I had everything, but I hated waking up in the morning. I hated going to work. I went in and out of depression. It affected our marriage, and I became a person that I didnt recognize anymore. I saw my life 30 years in the future, and I saw myself still doing the same thing. So I finally decided to do something about it.Something was founding, with his wife Jennifer, Supply, a company that sells high end, patented single blade razors.[We] use aerospace-grade engineering and a single, American-made blade that is supremely close [when shaving] and comfortable, Patrick said during the episode.The Coddous said they put their life-savings into Supply and quit their jobs to focus on the business.
The US jet fighter that can do it all—maybe#On a mile-long assembly line in Ft. Worth, Texas, Lockheed Martin  is putting together a jet fighter that no one can match. The  F-35 Joint Strike Fighter will be stealthier, smarter, more  capable, and more flexible than any aircraft ever built.   It better be. Its costing American taxpayers close to $1  billion. A month.

Coca-Cola CEO: Consumer spending is robust heading into 2020#Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said he is feeling confident about the state of the consumer in 2020, even as trade tensions and concerns about sluggish economic growth continue.You walk around Davos and there are some sectors that are feeling the pressure coming out of 2019 and into 2020 — more on the manufacturing side, some of the big trade sectors, Quincey said on CNBCs Squawk Box on Wednesday. But the consumer seems to be robust around the world — yes, ups and downs, but theyre doing pretty well.The International Monetary Fund on Monday revised its forecasts downward for 2019 and 2020, mostly due to slowing growth in India. The IMF also warned about uncertainty related to trade, which would weigh on the global economy.At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, business leaders have expressed doubts that China and the United States will reach phase two of a trade deal before the end of President Donald Trumps first term.Still, Quincey said that the company is confident about consumer spending in 2019 and sees momentum heading into 2020. In October, Cokes third-quarter revenue beat analyst estimates as consumers spent money on healthier options, like Zero Sugar soda and smaller size cans.The beverage giant will report its fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 30.
Gerber: Dont miss out on this huge opportunity in oil#If youre an investor avoiding the oil space, you could be  missing out on the best opportunity in years.  Thats what one veteran investment manager is arguing —  comparing the oil  glut to the opportunity presented to investors during the depths of the housing crisis.   There is enormous opportunity in the oil area. We are doing a  lot of research there. We look at it kind of like housing in  2010, Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and  Investment Management , said Tuesday on CNBCs Futures Now.   In the past six years, the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF has rallied by  more than 100 percent. Gerber believes the oil sector could  be positioning itself for similar gains.  The market has been totally beholden to oil over the last three  to six months. ... Were exiting a period where we feared total  devastation in the oil patch leading to bankruptcies and  defaults, he said, even as volatility continues to grip the area. Its only the beginning of the fixing of this process.  Crude oil, which has surged by nearly 25 percent in the past  eight weeks, has been under pressure again this week due to  oversupply concerns. But its not discouraging Gerber from  sticking to his bullish case.  The supply and demand imbalance still exists currently. But weve seen some supply come off the market, and weve seen an increase in demand, which has created a little more of a perception of stability, he said. We think oil will probably sit around the $40 to $45 which were fine with. Its the best benefit to the economy and the oil producers can continue to exist.
Video game maker to open theme park in Malaysia#Ubisoft, the maker of video games including Assassins Creed and Just Dance, plans to build a games-themed amusement park in  Malaysia, the company announced this week.The 10,000-square meter park will be based in Malaysias capital  city of Kuala Lumpur and will open in 2020, according to Ubisoft.   It will feature rides based on the French companys popular  franchises, such as Rayman Raving Rabbids.
Imminent Greek Deal Helps Stocks, but Earnings Coming#A stronger euro, weaker dollar has helped equities all day as the markets believe a Greek deal is imminent. At 2 PM ET the Greek Prime Minister spoke, appealing for passage of the unpopular austerity act, and markets rose to the high of the day. The big picture soon will turn to earnings....there has been no appreciable change in earnings expectations for the S&P 500 in the past two months, either for Q2 or the full year...but the S&P 500 is down 6% from the highs at the end of April...the market is telling us earnings expectations seem too high. We are expecting fairly robust Q2 numbers: revenue growth of 10 percent for the S&P 500, earnings growth of 16 percent. Sixteen percent is definitely robust earnings growth...and to top it off companies are consistently beating the estimates. In Q1, for example, analysts were looking for 13 percent earnings growth, we got close to 20 percent. Can that trend continue in Q2 and the rest of the year? Traders are very skeptical it can. One complaint: much of the earnings growth in Q2 is coming from energy and materials sector—thanks to higher commodity prices! Those prices, it appear, are moderating. Thats good news for consumers, but it will likely keep guidance from commodity producers on the conservative side. _____________________________Bookmark CNBC Data Pages:_____________________________Want updates whenever a Trader Talk blog is filed?

Feds Evans sees fiscal boost to US growth, wants slow#The U.S. Federal Reserve should raise interest rates slowly even as fiscal policies under President Donald Trump are likely to help push economic growth beyond sustainable levels, Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans said on Friday.Appropriate policy calls for a slow pace of normalization in order to give the real economy an adequate growth buffer to withstand downside shocks, Evans said in remarks prepared for delivery at Prairie State College in Olympia Fields, south of Chicago. I favor taking a gradual path for the adjustment of the funds rate back toward its long-run level.The Fed in December raised rates for only the second time since the financial crisis, and this week held them steady to give labor markets and inflation a chance to strengthen further.Most Fed officials see three rate hikes this year, a pace considerably faster than in 2016 and 2015 but much slower than in past rate-hike cycles. Evans, who votes this year on Fed policy, did not specify a preferred number of rate hikes for this year in his prepared remarks, though a few weeks ago said three is not implausible.Evans said he expects the economy to grow at a 2 percent to 2.5 percent annual pace for the next couple of years, faster than its long-run sustainable pace of about 1.75 percent. Evans said he raised his estimate for growth because of expected tax cuts and other stimulus under Trump and the new Congress.Unemployment will fall to 4.25 percent over the next couple years, he predicted, well below its long-run sustainable rate of 4.7 percent. And that will help push inflation, now at about 1.7 percent, back up towards the Feds 2 percent goal by 2019.Some analysts have speculated that the expansionary fiscal policies Trump has promised would light such a fire under an economy essentially already at full employment that the Fed would have no choice but to hike rates faster to brake growth.Evans on Friday did not seem too concerned about such a prospect. He warned, as he has before, that if the economy is pushed to grow at 4 percent for more than a couple years without structural reforms that boost productivity and labor force growth, inflationary pressures would build and would ultimately force the Fed to tighten financial conditions.But he also said his estimates are for a much more moderate fiscal boost, though he added it is early in the legislative process and there certainly is a possibility of larger temporary stimulus, as well as some policies that might influence longer-run growth.A government report early Friday showing U.S. employers added more jobs than expected last month was very good news, Evans said.The unemployment rate moved up to 4.8 percent from 4.7 percent, but that was likely because of more people entering the workforce, a good sign for labor market health, Evans said at an event to benefit Prairie State College in Olympia Fields, south of Chicago.
Top Investor Whitney Tilson’s Latest Real Estate Plays#He made a pretty penny shorting real estate ahead of the housing bubble. Find out where top investor Whitney Tilson of T2 Partners sees opportunity in real estate, now!In a live interview on CNBC’s Fast Money Tilson presents the desk with two trading ideas.Long Howard HughesOn the bullish side, Tilson is very enthusiastic about Howard Hughes Corp. “It’s a collection of more than 30 assets that were part of General Growth Properties,” he says.”We think there’s a lot of potential to develop many of these properties. We’re not quite sure what it’s worth on the upside but we don’t think there’s much downside.And he adds top hedge fund manager Bill Ackman is the chairman, which makes him confident that management is aligned with shareholder interest.   Short St. JoeMeanwhile on the bearish side, Tilson doesn’t like St. Joe.“We are short St. Joe. It’s our largest short position,” Tilson says. “We think David Einhorn’s thesis is correct and the stock is worth a half to a third it’s current price.”As you may remember David Einhorn made headlines last year with his negative thesis on St. Joe and his criticism of St. Joe’s largest investor, Bruce Berkowitz.Tilson tells Fast Money he’s done additional research and has found even more reasons to be bearish.”If you go visit these developments many of them are literally ghost towns. Information we’re presenting shows the sale prices of lots and homes are being done at 10 or 20% of the peak valuation. St. Joe hasn’t taken any impairment on these assets and we think they’re going to have to.”Click here for a complimentary look at Tilsons presentation at the 7th annual Value Investing Congress.Click here to learn more about the Value Investing Congress

Mario Gabelli: These Trump stocks will be fine even without#Billionaire Mario Gabelli told CNBC on Thursday that he is making a bet on infrastructure even if the Trump administration doesnt deliver on its $1 trillion plan to improve roads, tunnels and bridges.In an appearance on CNBCs Halftime Report, the CEO, founder and chairman of Gamco Investors said the U.S. has to make investments in its crumbling infrastructure. He said President Donald Trumps proposed infrastructure plan will act as extra tail wind to the sector that is already likely to succeed.I think housing is going to do well. I think industrial construction is going to do OK, independent of Trumps plan, Gabelli said.Gabelli specifically likes Atlanta-based company Mueller Water, a major manufacturer and distributor of fire hydrants, gate valves and other water-related infrastructure products in North America. He said the company has recently come under new leadership and is responsible for providing at least half of the hydrants in the U.S.He has previously spoken favorably of infrastructure saying, Infrastructure is important because it helps fiscal stimulation, it offsets monetary policy, it helps the jobs in the middle of the country, it helps everyone.Gabelli comments came after Trump, who has struggled to get certain policy proposals off the ground, has vowed to cut red tape to speed up approval of infrastructure projects.
ECB Eyes September for Bank Stress Tests#The European  Central Bank (ECB) and European Banking Authority (EBA) are aiming to carry out a joint  stress test on Europes major banks in September, sources told Reuters. Austrias FMA markets watchdog said on Wednesday  that the EBA plans stress tests this year even as the European Central Bank prepares to  take on supervision of top lenders from 2014. Sources told Reuters that the ECB, which was  involved in the background of the last round of EBA stress tests, was set to take a more  central role before it assumes supervisory powers over the euro zones banks. The preference is to have the EBA and ECB run   together, rather than have the reputational damage of having two (different)  ones, said a central bank source. The tests are likely to be in September, he  added. Other sources said they also expected the tests in September, though the date has not yet  been finalized. The EBAs predecessor the Committee of European  Banking Supervisors (CEBS) started conducting stress tests on major lenders such as Deutsche  Bank, Santander and Unicredit in 2010. But the shortcomings of the probes were laid bare  when Irelands banking system came close to collapse only four months after being given  a clean bill of health. As we said last year, we expect a new round of  stress tests in 2013 and discussions are on-going, an EBA spokeswoman said. ECB Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny said  last month that Europe wanted the ECB and the EBA to conduct coordinated stress  tests. EBA Chairman Andrea Enria has said that a key  addition to the next test willbe an examination of the quality of assets held by banks to  ensure they canabsorb losses properly in a crisis and leave taxpayers off the  hook. The discussions between the ECB and EBA partly  focus on working out how tomeasure the quality of banks loans. There will be a stress test this year from the  EBA. That is the current status of the decision, Financial Markets Authority co-head  Helmut Ettl told a news conference on Wednesday, adding details were still under  discussion. He said Austrian lenders Raiffeisen Zentralbank - the unlisted parent of Raiffeisen Bank International -and  Erste Group Bank would be tested. Europe agreed a deal last month to give the ECB new  powers to supervise euro zone banks from 2014, embarking on the first step in a new phase  of closer integration to help underpin the euro. The EBA monitors banks in all 27 EU member  states.
TEXT-S&P revises Crown Castle outlook to stable from positive#(The following statement was released by the rating agency)Overview-- U.S. tower operator Crown Castle has agreed to acquire rights to about7,200 T-Mobile USA towers for $2.4 billion in cash.-- We expect leverage to increase to nearly 8x at the end of 2012, proforma for the transaction, and decline modestly to the mid-7x area in 2013.-- We are revising our outlook on the company to stable from positivesince we no longer expect it to achieve leverage of 7x within our two-yearrating horizon.-- We are affirming all ratings on the company, including our B+corporate credit rating;-- Issue and recovery ratings for Crown and its related entities remainunchanged at present, but will be re-evaluated when the company outlines adefinitive financing plan for the T-Mobile transaction.Rating ActionOn Oct. 2, 2012, Standard & Poors Ratings Services revised its outlook onCrown Castle International Corp.to stable from positive as a result ofthe companys announced agreement to acquire rights to T-Mobiles 7,200 towersin a debt-financed transaction valued at about $2.4 billion. At the same time,we affirmed all of Crowns ratings, including the B+ corporate credit rating.RationaleThe outlook revision reflects our view that there is no longer a one-thirdprobability of an upgrade given the additional debt associated with theacquisition. We now expect leverage, including our adjustments for operatingleases, to be nearly 8x as of the end of 2012, pro forma for the EBITDAcontribution from the T-Mobile towers. While we believe that the combinationof contractual rent increases, additional tenant colocation revenues on itsexisting towers, and somewhat faster revenue growth on the T-Mobile towerswill contribute to a low- to mid-teen percent increase in EBITDA in 2013, wedont expect leverage to drop to 7x or below before 2014 at the earliest. Ourpositive outlook had incorporated the possibility that Crowns leverage wouldimprove to 7x or less within our two-year rating horizon, which we no longerbelieve is achievable.The ratings on Crown reflect the companys aggressive financial policy, givenits historical use of debt and excess cash flow to fund large stockrepurchases. As a result, adjusted leverage is high, at about 7x for the 12months ended June 30, 2012. We anticipate that the company will benefit fromtower leasing revenue growth over the next year due to price increases in itscontracts and the addition of new tenants on its tower sites, which shouldcontribute to an increase in EBITDA in the mid- to high-single-digit area for2012 and 2013. The T-Mobile towers, which have a lower tenancy per tower thanCrowns own business, have somewhat higher growth potential, although ourassumption for the addition of tenants on these towers is fairly conservative.Moreover, given the companys aggressive financial policy, we believe it mayuse excess cash flow to repurchase stock rather than repay debt, especiallysince it has no near-term maturities.Crown is one of the largest independent tower operators in the U.S., with atotal portfolio of approximately 24,000 towers, in addition to variousdistributed antennae systems. Pro forma for the T-Mobile transaction, thecompany will operate a portfolio of over 30,000 towers.We view the business risk profile as strong.The business generates cashflows with a high degree of stability, given the long-term nature of thewireless carrier contracts and high renewal rates. In addition, there has beena trend toward longer term contracts in this business and carriers have littleto no flexibility to terminate early without fully honoring the contract.Typical of the tower leasing industry, the high operating leverage of thebusiness also contributes to extremely healthy tower gross profit and overallunadjusted EBITDA margins, which were 74.6% and 62.6%, respectively, for thesecond quarter of 2012. A high percentage of the business EBITDA cantranslate into discretionary free cash flow, given very modest maintenancecapital expenditures. However, we expect Crown to use a significant amount ofits discretionary cash flows to continue to repurchase its common stock.Crown benefits from continued subscriber growth in the wireless communicationsindustry, which has expanded both in terms of absolute subscribers andper-subscriber minutes of use. These trends and the need for more coverage andcapacity to accommodate demand have translated into additional tenants leasingspace on existing towers, a trend known as colocation. Moreover, the majorcarriers have upgraded their networks to provide higher speed wireless datacapabilities, which in many cases, has required additional tower equipment.The regional carriers also have increasingly added to their coverage areas tooffer plans competitive with the national players, which, in turn, haveboosted tower leasing revenues.Crown also benefits from stable monthly cash flows from carriers withsubstantial financial resources, including Verizon Wireless and AT&T Mobility.These long-term contracts have very high renewal rates and average annual rentincreases of 3%. Moreover, the towers have the capacity to support multipletenants, providing additional upside to cash flows per tower, particularlybecause adding tenants to existing towers involves minimal incrementaloperating expense.LiquidityWe consider Crowns liquidity adequate. Sources of liquidity includeavailability of $1 billion under the revolving credit facility, coupled withthe expectation that the company will generate about $960 million of fundsfrom operations in 2012. We note that the company has not yet identified aspecific financing plan to fund the T-Mobile acquisition, although ouradequate liquidity assessment assumes it will be able to access the capitalmarkets for the transaction. We may revisit this assessment if the companydelays a financing plan or has difficulty in accessing the market.We expect that sources of liquidity will provide at least 1.2x coverage ofuses. We also expect Crown will continue to repurchase common stock, as wellas incur capital expenditures for land purchases, tower improvements, and newtower builds. The company is likely to maintain at least 15% minimum EBITDAcushion under its 6x total leverage covenant, which does not step down untilMarch 2014.Recovery analysisFor the complete recovery analysis, seethe recovery report on Crown, publishedAug. 2, 2012, on RatingsDirect.OutlookThe outlook is stable. As a result of Crowns acquisition of the leasingrights to the T-Mobile towers, we expect that its debt to EBITDA will benearly 8x for 2012, pro forma for the T-Mobile transaction. We expect thisleverage to decline to the mid-7x area by the end of 2013.The rating could be raised if we came to expect a leverage reduction to 7x orlower on a sustained basis, which could occur if EBITDA increases at around a13% rate in 2013 rather than the low- to mid-teen percent area we currentlyassume in our base-case scenario. Conversely, and less likely, in our view, wecould lower the rating if Crown were to become more aggressive in itsfinancial policy such that it used debt to repurchase stock for in excess of$5 billion, since this would increase leverage to the 10x area.Related Criteria And Research-- Business Risk/Financial Risk Matrix Expanded, Sept. 18, 2012-- U.S. Telecom And Cable Companies Maturities Are Manageable, ButLower-Rated Issuers Face Some Liquidity Challenges, July 23, 2012-- U.S. Telecom And Cable Companies, Strongest To Weakest, July 13, 2012-- U.S. Telecom And Cable Ratings Should Be Stable Overall During WeakEconomic Recovery, July 13, 2012-- A Matter of Policy: U.S. Telecom Companies Maintain High DividendPayouts, But For How Long?, May 30, 2012-- A Matter of Policy: U.S. Cable And Satellite-TV Companies Ratchet UpShareholder Payouts, May 16, 2012-- Top 10 Investor Questions: U.S. Telecom and Cable Industries, May 10,2012-- Assessing The Four-Notch Rating Gap Between The Two U.S.Direct-To-Home Satellite Video Operators, May 9, 2012-- Liquidity Descriptors For Global Corporate Issuers, Sept. 28, 2011Ratings ListRatings Affirmed; Outlook ActionTo                 FromCrown Castle International Corp.Corporate Credit Rating                B+/Stable/--       B+/Positive/--Ratings Affirmed; Recovery Ratings UnchangedCrown Castle International Corp.Senior Unsecured                       B-Recovery Rating                      6CC Holdings GS V LLCCrown Castle GS III Corp.Senior Secured                         BBRecovery Rating                      1Crown Castle Operating Co.Senior Secured                         B+Recovery Rating                      4Complete ratings information is available to subscribers of RatingsDirect onthe Global Credit Portal at.

Cramers lightning round: GoPros stock could go higher on a#GoPro Inc.: I think that GoPros going to have a good holiday season. Theyve got all new stuff. I think it could trade to $8, but I dont think its getting more than that because its pretty darn speculative.Eli Lilly and Co.: I think Eli Lilly is very good, but it has had such a run that I can no longer countenance buying it up at these levels.HealthEquity Inc.: I think its interesting. I mean, look, I think that if Paychex decided they wanted to get into that business, exactly in that niche, I think that they could do great and they could actually do it pretty well through corporations, so I dont know if theres a big enough moat there.General Mills Inc.: They bought this Blue Buffalo. Heres the problem: I dont like the stock because they took down too much money to pay for Blue Buffalo. They overpaid. Theyve bought a lot of stock much higher and then theyre selling lower. That is not my kind of company.Marriott Intl.: This is just people just saying the business cycles reaching a conclusion. Its all about the Fed, otherwise Marriott would be higher because [CEO] Arne [Sorenson]s doing a great job.

Parents are sacrificing their own financial wellness to support their#Many American parents are financially supporting their adult children at the expense of their own financial wellness.Almost half, or 45%, of parents with adult offspring have given their children money during the coronavirus pandemic and of those 79% said the funds would have otherwise gone towards their own personal finances, a survey from CreditCards.com found.It wasnt just chump change, either. Those with an annual household income of less than $40,000 gave an average of $1,403, while those with a household income of $40,000 to $80,000 gave $2,170 on average. Parents who had an annual household income of more than $80,000 gave their kids an average $8,530.This is holding them back from paying off their own credit card debt, said Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at CreditCards.com. It is impacting their ability to save for the future.
Most important 2020 election misinformation threat is not coming from#As 2020 Election Day nears, technology companies like Facebook are doing a better job than they did in 2016 in fighting the social media misinformation campaigns of foreign adversaries like Russia and Iran, according to Alex Stamos. He should know — Stamos was a former security chief for the worlds largest social media platform.But the cybersecurity expert, who now is director of the Stanford Internet Observatory, says the toughest misinformation threat technology companies face, and cant solve, is from within the U.S. — disinformation sowed by U.S. politicians, and one figure, in particular.Whats changed in 2020 versus 2016 is the massive amount of cooperation between large and small technology platforms and the government. In 2016, it was really no ones job to think about how Russia or others might use online to cause chaos in the election, Stamos said at the CNBC Technology Executive Council virtual summit on Thursday.Now there is a dedicated group between the government and tech and massive takedowns of Russian assets and also Iran. A huge difference, he said.
Why one analyst thinks Netflix will rise another 67% in#Soaring shares of  are set to stream even higher, according to Rob Sanderson, a research analyst who covers the stock for MKM Partners.Ahead of Thursdays bell, Sanderson raised his 12-month price target on the then-$158 stock to $195. His bullish report appeared to put a bit more wind in Netflixs sails, as the tech giant rose a bit more than 3 percent in the session to close at $163. But if the analyst is right in his long-term call, the stock has even more substantial gains ahead than his current price target implies.To be sure, his target change did not rest on any massive reworking of expectations. Actually, the methodology that leads to his $195 price is almost pleasantly clinical.More from CNBC:Chart points to another 19% rally for Netflix, says top technicianAnalyst predicts a 50 percent crash for Netflix - but admits: It is likely that we will be wrong for a whileHow one trader plans to make a 300% profit on NetflixSanderson continues to expects the stock to earn $12.12 per share in 2021, and to trade at a forward price target of 22.5 in 2020 — leading to an expectation that the stock will trade at $273 in two and a half years time. He expects investors to discount this price by 25 percent for every year in the future it is (as a way to be compensated for the risk of Netflix not achieving those earnings and/or multiple).At the end of January, when Sanderson slapped his prior one-year price target on the stock, one year from then was about two years away from 2020 — so $273 was divided by 1 plus 25 percent, raised to the second power. Now, a year from now is about a year and a half from 2020, so $273 is divided by 1 plus 25 percent, raised to the 1.5st power. Hence the price target moves from $175 to $195.This simple arithmetic can cause one to forget the fact Sanderson is forecasting that Netflixs earnings will explode from about $0.50 in 2016 to more than $12 in five years time. And to further forecast that even after the stock does so, investors will still be sufficiently optimistic about future profits to slap a high earnings multiple on the company.Sanderson said in an interview Thursday on CNBCs Power Lunch that the company has more than ample opportunity to continue to scale up [its] content investment on a global basis, and that the subscriber opportunity is sufficiently large.While some might be tempted to bet against such heady expectations, Dennis Davitt of Harvest Volatility Management uses the harshest language to warn against doing so.Ive seen a lot of really good investors lose a great amount of money on stocks like Netflix, and that usually comes from when they short them, Davitt said Thursday on Power Lunch. Its a momentum stock.However, Davitt says it would be prudent for Netflix investors to buy a downside put on the stock, in order to maintain their upside while protecting themselves from the potential for great downside.I think Robs right, personally, he said. But if Robs not right, it costs you 5 percent to own the insurance policy on the stock.Netflix is up more than 30 percent year-to-date.
22. SimpliVity#Founder: Doron Kempel  Launched: 2009 Funding: $276 million Valuation: $1 billion  Disrupting: IT infrastructure Rival: NutanixIts always a vote of confidence when a big customer decides it believes so strongly in your company that it wants to become an investor as well. Thats the position SimpliVity is in. The Westborough, Massachusetts-based company is a leader in whats known as hyperconverged infrastructure for IT. Read MoreFULL LIST: 2016 DISRUPTOR 50In this case, the customer was Waypoint Capital, who, after using SimpliVitys infrastructure solution at five of its global sites — and being impressed with the results — decided to lead a $175 million round of financing last year. This brings the total amount of funding for the company to $276 million. Other investors include Accel Partners, Charles River Ventures and Meritech.Basically, the companys technology brings the virtual aspects of infrastructure together with the physical, resulting in a single solution for the customer. Simply put, it makes an all-in-one hardware box that combines server, storage and networking into one device. Its not unique, but the company claims it is cheaper and easier to install than competitors.Nearly half of SimpliVitys customers — Major League Baseball, cement maker Humboldt Wedag and Swisscom, among them — come from outside the United States. The company, founded by CEO Doron Kempel, a former Israeli Special Forces operative who earned an MBA from Harvard, has 750 employees in 24 countries and claims it grew its customer base 2.5 times in the past year.
The Brexit deal leaves the future uncertain for financial services#Britain formally left the European Unions trade bloc on Dec. 31, marking a new era for the U.K.-EU relationship.  After months of wrangling, new rules for trade were finally agreed just days before the year-end deadline. But in a document spanning over 1,200 pages, there was very little mention of financial services: a sector which accounts for 7% of the U.K.s economy and 10% of its tax receipts.  One particular issue that arises is the clearing of euro-denominated derivatives. The size of the European derivatives market topped 680 trillion euros ($834 trillion) in 2019, and the majority of European clearing activity takes place on London-based exchanges such as LCH.So far, the European Securities and Markets Authority has agreed to roll over current clearing arrangements for these derivatives until June 22, giving more time for EU-based institutions to decrease their reliance on the British-based clearers. It has previously said it wants euro-denominated derivative trading to only take place within the EU, or somewhere with equivalent regulations.
Women speak of pervasive harassment in DC lobbying culture#She wanted a job, but it seemed the hiring partner wanted more.Olivia, a young consultant, was searching for a job in Washington when a firm expressed interest.But she remembers that the man interviewing her for the job, a senior partner, quickly veered into different territory. He insisted on taking her out for meals, with dinners accompanied by several bottles of wine.More from The Hill:Fox & Friends host on detained children: These arent our kidsPlanned Parenthood sues over Trumps changes to teen pregnancy prevention programSlavery apologies are empty rhetoric, not a real way forwardEvery time I wanted to talk about work, or the position, or the job, hed grab my hand and tell me, I just want to tell you how beautiful you are,  she said.I was contemplating it as an opportunity, as a viable opportunity. Its ridiculous that I would consider something that would subject me to sexual harassment for higher title and higher pay, she said.On K Street — the term for Washingtons cadre of lobbyists, political operatives and people working in public relations — deals are often done over dinner or drinks, on business travel or retreats.Much like Capitol Hill, the influence industry remains dominated by men, creating an environment where women say they are often subject to harassment and worse. Unlike in other industries, however, few women have been willing to come forward to talk about it.The Hill began reaching out to women on K Street last year, asking whether they had similar stories to those surfacing as part of the Me Too movement.More than a dozen women spoke about instances of sexual harassment or assault they say they have faced while working in the influence industry.Everyone interviewed by The Hill asked to talk anonymously in order to speak freely about their experiences, fearing they will be blacklisted in Washington. Their names have been changed to protect them.The employers are not named, nor are the men who they allege acted inappropriately.In addition to being apprehensive of hurting their future career prospects, some of the women are also worried about retaliation from the men themselves.Everything in this town is predicated on relationships, said one woman who works in public relations (PR). Why make waves? That could be the next person to hire you.Several of the women said working on K Street requires them to routinely deal with unwanted touching, inappropriate comments or text messages, and suggestive remarks about their bodies and appearances.All of them said they hoped sharing their experiences, however, would start a much-needed discussion about behavior by men in the influence industry and hopefully begin, as one woman described it, a course correction.A lobbyists job routinely involves travel around the country for fundraisers, advocacy and events. Women recounted experiences where, on occasion, alcohol-fueled socializing led to unwanted advances from colleagues, bosses and public officials.When they are away from their district or on the road, they think its a free-for-all, and their manners or morality is gone. Its out the window, said Allison, a lobbyist in her early 30s who said she has been harassed or assaulted by almost a dozen men, including other lobbyists and public officials, mostly when outside of Washington.During one trip to a political conference, Allison recalled how she and about 10 others decided to hang out poolside after a dinner and people went up to their hotel rooms to change.As she was getting ready with a friend, there was a knock at the door; it was another lobbyist attending the trip. Thinking he was there to walk down to the pool as a group, she opened the door to find him wearing an open robe with nothing underneath.Lets go skinny dipping, Allison recounts him saying.When she recoiled, saying What the f---?, the lobbyist laughed and said the whole thing was a joke.Harassment is sometimes about power, said Lisa Banks, a partner at Katz, Marshall & Banks who specializes in workplace harassment. Theres a power differential in Washington, and most of those people are men. Its certainly an environment thats ripe for this, but its also a horrible scenario.Banks says her firm has recently seen an influx of complaints from women about experiences of harassment, but about half of the accusations have gone beyond the statute of limitations. Some women, she says, call to report things that happened decades ago.(Disclosure: Katz, Marshall & Banks recently represented a woman who accused D.C. celebrity chef Mike Isabella and other higher-ups in the restaurant group of harassment. This writer formerly worked at Kapnos, an Isabella-owned restaurant, but left before the suit began and was not involved.)Whether working in Washington or elsewhere, all the women who spoke with The Hill say that it is common for their colleagues to laugh off bad behavior, blaming it on alcohol or a boys will be boys attitude.Though some of the unsavory conduct described to The Hill occurred when alcohol was involved, other incidents did not.One month into a new trade association job, a board member invited Olivia to his hometown, a cross-country trip that was purportedly for work, where they were supposed to be setting the associations goals and strategizing for the next year. He asked her to pick out some things to do and shows to see while she was there.Once she arrived, the two began working in the hotel suite, and when it came time to go out for the evening, he asked to change in the bathroom.The executive, who was married, emerged from the bathroom shortly after that with his pants undone, according to Olivia.He didnt solicit anything, but the innuendo was there, she added.While she managed to fend off his advances, she said his inappropriate behavior continued even after she returned home. He eventually got the hint, she says, though the two still had to work together.It was one of the more horrifying experiences, because you just dont know how to rectify it, she said. I did tell colleagues and my immediate boss about it, and they laughed it off and said, Thats how he is. I feel fortunate that I had the confidence and the voice to push back, Olivia added. Not everyone has that luxury.When women are harassed by board members or elected officials — those not employed by their own organization — coming forward about abuse can be complicated.After two receptions one night, a trade association lobbyist named Leslie recalled heading to another event in a group. A board member sat next to her and, despite being surrounded by others, tried to get her to kiss him.He kept saying things like Why wont you just kiss me? and Seriously, just kiss me right now,  she said. I climbed literally all the way over to the other side of the Uber. I was screaming I have a boyfriend! I have a boyfriend! Not that [having a boyfriend] means anything, Leslie added.Employers are legally obligated to protect employees from abuse, regardless of whether the harasser is part of an organization, said Debra Katz, of Katz Marshall & Banks.If they become aware that a board member, an elected official or even a [client] has acted inappropriately or sexually harassed an employee, the employer has the obligation to take corrective measures, Katz said. The employee must also agree on whatever actions are taken by the employer.In the corporate world, employers are seeking out answers on how to deal with harassment and make sure policies around it are state of the art, said Jason Schwartz, a lawyer specializing in employment law at Gibson Dunn.A lot of lobbying and PR shops may not have a sophisticated, built-out [human resources] HR operation. A lot of this is unfamiliar territory to them, he said. People are struggling to figure out how to respond.Rather than relying on a HR or legal department, Schwartz said some employers have opted to have an anonymous reporting system or designate a rotating employee as a safe person to confide in. Punishments are also important, he says.Some of Schwartzs clients have implemented a clause that employees bonuses could be taken away should a negative report be made against them.These kinds of concerns are being taken far more seriously now than they ever were, Schwartz said.But punishments become all the more complicated when its the men in senior roles who are accused of misconduct, which makes reporting their behavior difficult.Some K Street offices, women say, have a hypermasculine culture that makes it hard to come forward.Human resources is there to protect management, theyre not here to protect the people who report to them, said Liz, who worked for a trade association at the time. Her sentiment was echoed by nearly every woman who spoke to The Hill.Anything you said to HR went immediately back to the manager, and youd get called into the managers office and get screamed at for going to HR.Several women told The Hill that theyve worked at firms where the men leading it talk repeatedly and openly about the women in the office, commenting on their bodies and their clothing in ways that go beyond innocent compliments.During presentations led by a woman at a large trade group, the men in the room would allegedly send each other explicit and vulgar text messages, according to a woman shown those messages by one of the men.Male members of the association allegedly passed a list ranking how much they wanted to sleep with women from the Washington office. It was called the f---ability factor list.They would love to come up and tell you if youve dropped off the list or if youve been relegated to a lower ranking by, for example, getting married, Liz recalled.Three other women told The Hill that men, including high-ranking government officials and executives, would send them explicit text messages — occasionally with graphic photos — talking about their bodies and what it would be like to have sex with them.In a trade associations Washington office, a man would habitually engage in phone sex during work hours, according to another man in the office who witnessed it.Every afternoon, like clockwork, I would hear panting, heavy breathing, said Brandon, whose desk was near the executives office. There were these conversations that registered above a whisper. ... When I listened closer, they were phone sex conversations.A second person who worked in that office at the time described to The Hill similar conduct by this person. Allegedly, once a complaint had been filed, the man was made to reimburse the group for the cost of the calls.Margaret, a woman who then worked at a consulting firm, recalled that high-ranking executives would come to her office and talk about sexual conquests and whom they found attractive, sometimes giving unsolicited shoulder rubs.She called it harassment creep, where actions start small and escalate into increasingly inappropriate behavior.One would put his leg up on my desk and it would be directly eye level with me, Margaret said. They want to see your reaction, to see how far they can take it with you.Two women described a tactic utilized during greetings or staged photo ops with clients and association members — each pointing to elected officials as the worst offenders.Rather than putting a hand here [while posing for a photo], said Margaret, grabbing her waist, itll be up here. She put her hand much higher, discreetly cupping the side of her breast.Another woman said one particular K Street executive would hug her in a similar way.I call it the side-boob hug, she said. It is a pro trick. … I think they teach this when they get inaugurated. It has happened a bunch with elected officials. Or they find a way to grab your ass. Its amazing how often it happens.One of the biggest issues surrounding the debate over sexual harassment in every industry is that women have different interpretations of what crosses the line.In an occupation where the job description involves being nice in order to push a cause or raise money, one lobbyist named Jennifer said that men often get the wrong impression. She said that other lobbyists she knows have propositioned her for sex.I think its terrible, but I feel less harassed and more like they are testing the waters because it must have worked for them before. As soon as Im like, Uh, no, they apologize, Jennifer said, adding, Thats happened quite often, actually.Legally, in most cases, unwanted comments or inappropriate touching must be continuous for an individual to file a lawsuit. The accusers must also show that the harmful environment was severe and pervasive, Katz said.One woman who worked at trade associations before joining a large K Street firm says she faced retaliation after coming forward about being harassed by a fellow lobbyist.An outside lobbyist hired by the organization where she worked pushed her against the wall of an elevator and tried to kiss her. Although he pulled back when she told him to stop, he began to send her a stream of text messages talking about how he wanted to be with her and how he was unhappy in his marriage.The lobbyist was close with other men in her office, and after she complained, her boss began to schedule lobbying outings involving things she hated and wouldnt do: golf and cigar smoking.You dont have to terminate someone, but you can make their workplace a living hell, she said.
Trump sued by Democratic lawmakers over foreign state payments to#More than 190 Democratic lawmakers sued President Donald Trump in federal court on Wednesday, saying he had accepted funds from foreign governments through his businesses without congressional consent in violation of the U.S. Constitution.  The complaint said Trump had not sought congressional approval for any of the payments his hundreds of businesses had received from foreign governments since he took office in January, even though the Constitution requires him to do so.  The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment but has said Trumps business interests do not violate the Constitution. The Trump Organization has said it will donate profits from customers representing foreign governments to the U.S. Treasury but will not require such customers to identify themselves.  At least 30 U.S. senators and 166 representatives are plaintiffs in Wednesdays lawsuit, representing the largest number of legislators ever to sue a U.S. president, according to two lawmakers who are among the plaintiffs.  The Constitutions foreign emoluments clause bars U.S. officeholders from accepting payments and various other gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval.  The presidents failure to tell us about these emoluments, to disclose the payments and benefits that he is receiving, mean that we cannot do our job. We cannot consent to what we dont know, said Senator Richard Blumenthal, one of the lawmakers bringing the lawsuit, in a conference call on Tuesday.  Representative John Conyers, another plaintiff, added: President Trump has conflicts of interest in at least 25 countries, and it appears hes using his presidency to maximize his profits.  The Justice Department declined to comment.  Similar lawsuits have been filed in recent months by parties including a nonprofit ethics group, a restaurant trade group, and the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia.  They allege that Trumps acceptance of payments from foreign and U.S. governments through his hospitality empire puts other hotel and restaurant owners at an unfair disadvantage and provides governments an incentive to give Trump-owned businesses special treatment.  Rare to sue president  In a motion to dismiss one such lawsuit on Friday, the Justice Department argued that the plaintiffs had not shown any specific harm to their businesses, and that Trump was only banned from receiving foreign government gifts if they arose from his service as president.  On Monday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said partisan politics was behind the lawsuit by the Maryland and District of Columbia officials.  Lawmakers rarely sue the president, so there are few federal court decisions the legislators can cite to prove their legal standing to bring Wednesdays case, said Leah Litman, an assistant professor specializing in constitutional law at the University of California, Irvine.  But the constitutional provision theyre suing to enforce gives them a role in how its carried out, and that gives them a powerful standing argument, Litman said.  The lawmakers in Wednesdays lawsuit will be represented in court by the Constitutional Accountability Center, a public interest law firm in Washington.Each lawmaker is paying a share of the legal fees from personal or campaign accounts.Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

Cost Cuts Help Blockbuster First-Quarter Profit#Blockbuster, the largest U.S. movie rental chain, posted a higher-than-expected quarterly profit as it cut costs by closing stores, reducing advertising and overhead expenses.Blockbusters  shares rose 33 cents, or nearly 11 percent, to $3.40 in premarket trading Thursday.Blockbuster, which has offered to buy Circuit City Stores for up to $1.3 billion, said sales at domestic stores open at least a year improved for the first time in five years due to a better line-up of new movies, improved in-store merchandising and more effective pricing.Net profit was $45.4 million, or 20 cents per share, for its fiscal first quarter that ended April 6, compared with a year-earlier loss of $49 million or 27 cents per share.Adjusted earnings from continuing operations were 21 cents in the quarter, beating the average Wall Street forecast of 16 cents, according to Reuters Estimates.While quarterly revenue missed expectations, Blockbuster managed to cut selling, general and administrative expenses by $100.5 million on reduced advertising and lower overheads.Blockbuster is repositioning itself to compete with new video distribution models provided by companies like Netflix and Apple.Chairman and Chief Executive Jim Keyes said in a statement that the companys Total Access program, which lets subscribers swap DVDs at Blockbuster stores for unlimited free rentals, was now profitable.Domestic same-store sales rose 2.9 percent, driven by a 19.7 percent rise in merchandise sales and a 0.4 increase in rental revenue, the company said.Overall quarterly revenue fell 5.4 percent to $1.39 billion as Blockbuster closed stores, compared to the average analyst forecast of $1.44 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.Blockbuster said its gross margin rose 1.5 percentage points to 53.2 percent in the quarter.After resisting requests for months, Circuit City last week finally said it would open its books to Blockbuster and its largest shareholder, billionaire investor Carl Icahn.But Blockbusters bid continues to draw skepticism from some analysts who question the strategic fit of the two struggling companies just as Blockbuster is staging a turnaround.

Trump: If I lose, Ill have a nice long vacation#Donald Trump made  a rare allowance on CNBC on Thursday that he may lose the  presidential election, but he said he will not back away from his  uncensored style.  Im a truth teller. All I do is tell the truth, Trump said on  Squawk Box in a  phone interview. And if at the end of 90 days, Ive fallen short  ... its OK. I go back to a very good way of life.  Trump has previously questioned the integrity of the electoral  system, which had some outsiders wondering if he was preparing an  explanation for a potential loss.  Im afraid the elections going to be rigged, I have to be  honest, Trump recently told an Ohio crowd. However, in his comments Thursday he seemed to be preparing  for a loss with a more conciliatory tone.  I think were going to have victory, but well see, Trump  said. At the end its either going to  work or Im going to, you know, Im going to have a very, very  nice long vacation.
Trump policies to boost S&P 500 by 15% to 2,500#Deutsche Bank strategist David Bianco told investors the market  will rally over the next two years on optimism about President-elect  Donald Trumps economic agenda.  We think the market is under appreciating the likely big boost  to S&P EPS from a lower corporate tax rate and the boost to bank profits from rising yields (and lower pension expense) and  the much higher chance now of a long-lasting economic expansion  that rivals the 10-year U.S. record, Bianco wrote in a note to  clients Friday.  Were more confident now that the S&P will reach 2,500 in  2018 before suffering its next bear market.
Oil slides more than 3% as virus cases mount#Oil prices on Tuesday fell more than 3%, although closed off their lowest levels of the day, on worries about the outlook for fuel demand as Europe and the United States grappled with a surge in new coronavirus infections.Stock and commodities investors remained cautious ahead of the first U.S. presidential debate between Democrat Joe Biden and Republican Donald Trump later on Tuesday.The energy market was also waiting for weekly updates on U.S. crude stockpiles from the American Petroleum Institute (API) on Tuesday and the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday.Analysts polled by Reuters forecast U.S. crude inventories increased 1.6 million barrels last week.On its second to last day as the front-month, Brent futures for November delivery fell $1.60, or 3.8%, to $40.83 a barrel, while the more active Brent contract for December fell 3.6% to $41.33.West Texas Intermediate crude fell $1.31, or 3.2%, to settle at $39.29 per barrel.More than a million people worldwide have died from COVID-19, according to a Reuters tally, a bleak milestone in a pandemic that has devastated the global economy and demand for fuel.New York City will impose fines on people who refuse to wear a face covering as the rate of positive coronavirus tests climbed above 3% for the first time in months, Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Tuesday.The evolving COVID landscape is a massive downside risk for crude prices, said Craig Erlam, senior analyst at OANDA.The heads of the worlds largest trading houses predicted tepid oil demand recovery and flat prices in the coming months and possibly even years.Clashes between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh region have also kept markets on edge. If the conflict escalates, it could affect oil and gas exports from Azerbaijan.In Libya, meanwhile, the Sarir oilfield has restarted production, the head of the company that operates it said on Tuesday, after eastern forces lifted an eight-month blockade on energy facilities.

Expert Advice: More Danger Likely in Financials#Investors should stay away from financial stocks and be cautious about commodity and material investments as well, according to one money manager.This credit unwinding has a lot further to go, Jack De Gan, chief investment officer of Boston-based Harbor Advisory told CNBC.  He recalled Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfeins observation that the low point in financial securities wont be reached with the markdowns, but with the liquidations, which he thinks are still to come.    He made an exception for Berkshire Hathaway , his firms largest holding, which is 25 percent higher than it was in August, when news of the credit crunch started to break.    De Gan is also reluctant to venture into larger industrials.  If credit does contract the way we think it will, the financials will have to contract their balance sheets, and that will slow the general economy, he said.

Yuan Outlook is no Yawn: Strategist#The yuan has had a big move against the dollar, and this strategist says there is more to come. Its not every day the yuan  rises to a record high against the dollar, but itposted its biggest gain in two months today - possibly thanks to central bank intervention. Greg Salvaggio, senior vice president of capital markets at Tempest Consulting, thinks the move is only logical.We think what the Chinese are doing is really what theyve always done - a gradual, managed appreciation of their currency, he says. What they did is come in overnight and really demonstrate to people Hey, were committed to this appreciation. Salvaggio told CNBCs Scott Wapner he thinks the yuan could rise five to seven percent against the dollar in 2012.
Now that taxes aren’t such a big worry, here’s what’s#With individual tax rates down, a new boogeyman is haunting investors: inflation worries.Those were the findings from the American Institute of CPAs Personal Financial Satisfaction Index, which measures investors financial pleasure or financial pain based on a range of economic factors, including personal taxes, inflation, job openings and real home equity.Overall, the Personal Financial Satisfaction Index has crept up to 27.7 in the second quarter, from 27.0 in the first three months of the year. This reflects increased job openings and strong stock market performance.However, inflation took the lead as a source of financial pain, edging out worries about taxes. The AICPAs blended inflation measure in the second quarter was 2.3 percent, up 0.6 percent from the first quarter.Up until the second quarter, taxes were the leading cause of pain for the prior eight quarters.Even though inflation has gone up, its still pretty darn low, relatively speaking, said Michael Eisenberg, a CPA, personal financial specialist and member of the American Institute of CPAs Consumer Financial Education Advocates.People get nervous when they see or hear about inflation, he said. It eats away your purchasing power over time.Heres what rising inflation means for your finances.
Stellantis jumps 11% in NYSE debut. Heres what you need#Shares of Stellantis – the merged automaker of Fiat Chrysler and France-based Groupe PSA – jumped by more than 11% in their trading debut on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.The $52 billion merger was finalized Saturday, and the combined companys shares started trading Monday under STLA on Euronext in Paris and the Borsa Italiana in Milan. Trading of U.S.-based shares, under the same ticker symbol, were delayed a day because the U.S. markets were closed Monday for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.Stellantis is the worlds fourth-largest automaker by volume. The companys operations, including its 400,000 employees, will largely be in North America and Europe.
Strides in space farming may boost plan to build human#Scientists are making strides in growing food in space, and their efforts could  be critical to eventually supporting a permanent human colony  on Mars.We can grow plants on Mars just by compressing the  atmosphere, SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk said Tuesday in a  long-awaited speech detailing his vision for sending humans to  Mars by 2025. The billionaire engineer said the Red Planet is  resource rich with water ice and compounds necessary to support  plants, such as nitrogen.  Experts say astronauts could pack enough packaged or freeze-dried  food to get to Mars and back, although living on the planet for  extended periods would get increasingly difficult without regular  food-supply missions. Mars would require a six-month journey to  the planet, an 18-month stay and a six-month trip back.
Beer Choice Matters for Seattle Mariners Fans#The Seattle Mariners may not win Major League Baseballs Western  Division this year but there is one category where they can  challenge any team in baseball: beer variety at the ball park.  Thanks to the efforts of Safeco Field stadium concessionaire  Centerplate, fans attending a Mariners game can choose from more  than 50 different varieties of beer sold on draft, in bottles and  even limited-release, 22-ounce bomber bottles.  —  The beer list at Safeco is simply a reflection of the culture of  the Pacific Northwest, Centerplate said. The Mariners play in  Seattle, and Washington State has more than 150 different  breweries.  We have a unique demographic thats very highly educated about  beer, said Steve Dominguez, Centerplate general manager. They  tell us what they are looking for and we seek to meet that demand  with the right variety of flavors.  While a beer list boasting more than 50 options for any one game  is impressive, dig a little deeper and its clear just how  serious the Mariners and Centerplate take their beer offerings.  As the weather changes during the months-long Major League seball  season, so too do the beer offerings.
Gundlach: Gold is going to $1,500#Its one thing to say gold is going higher. But, when Jeffrey  Gundlach, manager of the $49 billion DoubleLine, says he thinks  gold will hit $1,500 per ounce by the end of this year, thats  something people pay attention to.  In a webcasted presentation called Penny For Your Thoughts,  Gundalch noted the 96 percent reduction in the U.S. dollars  purchasing power since the Federal Reserve Bank was established a  century ago, likening the end of the gold standard to the silver  debasement of the Roman denarius from 64 to 270 AD. During the  question and answer period, Gundlach said he thought gold could  move to $1,500 this year.  The last time gold was at $1,500 was in April, 2013. Gold traded  at $1,260 per ounce on Wednesday.  (Watch: Stocks slide; worst hit in 3  weeks for Dow, S&P 500)  Of course, theres a chance [Gundlach] could be right and gold  could go higher, said Richard Ross, global technical strategist  at Auerbach Grayson. But, theres very little in the short-term  technicals to suggest that move has begun in earnest.  Gold has been trading in a range between $1,180 and $1,400 for  much of the past year, notes Ross. For the short-term, he is  keeping an eye on the $1,270 line, which is close to the current  150-day moving average. A break back above that level could set  us up for a retest of that resistance around 1,400, said Ross.  However, that range should be seen in the context of the  longer-term chart, according to Ross, a Talking Numbers  contributor. Were still in a downtrend from the highs that we  established back around 1,900, he said.  Ross sees golds break below its 150-week moving average as  technically significant. Since the start of 2013, the 150-week  moving average has been relatively flat, near the $1,525 level.  Youve got to get through 1,400 before you can trade 1,500,  clearly, said Ross. And, in the shorter term, youve got  through 1,270 before you can trade 1,400. So, theres a lot of  ifs and buts here in that argument. We really need to see a base  breakout before we can call this a base.  Gina Sanchez, founder of Chantico Global, said that while theres  a possibility that gold could go higher, she thinks the chances  are low. The World Banks reduction of global growth from 3.2  percent to 2.8 percent may cause some flight-to-safety buying of  bullion. And, global interest rates are low, which traditionally  augurs well for the yellow metal. But, Sanchez believes that  wont last.  (Watch: World Bank: Now is the time  to prepare for next crisis)  Even though were in a benign interest rate environment in the  U.S. – and certainly within Europe and Japan – I do  think that in the U.S., rates will likely start to trend higher  by the end of the year or into 2015, said Sanchez, a CNBC  contributor. Thats not great for gold. We dont see a ton of  inflation. If anything, maybe theres some deflationary  pressures, particularly in Europe.  Gold needs to feed on something, said Sanchez, but she doesnt  see a lot of major economic pessimism or inflation worries.  Im not sure that I see why gold, except for some short-term  reasons, might pop a little, added Sanchez.

Lowes sales top Street expectations, boosted by hurricane-related purchases#Lowes on Thursday reported third-quarter earnings and sales that outpaced analysts expectations, as more shoppers turned up for emergency supplies and repairs following devastating hurricanes and wildfires.Heres what Lowes reported, compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a Thomson Reuters survey of analysts:Net income climbed to $872 million, or $1.05 a share, in the fiscal third quarter, from $379 million, or 43 cents, a year earlier. The year-ago period included $462 million of noncash pretax charges.The home improvement retailers sales rose 6.5 percent, to $16.8 billion from $15.7 billion in the period last year. Hurricane-related sales totaled roughly $200 million in the third quarter, Lowes said.Sales at Lowes stores open at least a year climbed 5.7 percent, also topping Street expectations. Lumber, appliances and  plumbing and electrical materials were top sellers.Repairs resulting from the hurricanes have blown Lowes sales into much firmer growth territory, GlobalData Retail Managing Director Neil Saunders wrote in a note to clients.It is not just natural disasters that are keeping Lowes numbers aloft, solid levels of activity in the housing market and a willingness among consumers to invest in the home also continue to drive the DIY market, Saunders added. This is benefiting Lowes, although not quite as much as it is Home Depot — which remains the destination of choice for many casual improvers and professionals.After initially rising following the earnings report, Lowes shares fell less than 1 percent Tuesday morning.Looking to the full year, Lowes still expects revenue to increase roughly 5 percent by the end of fiscal 2017, with sales at its established stores rising 3.5 percent. Lowes is also on track to have added about 25 home improvement and hardware stores before the year is over.The current fourth quarter brings tough comps, unknown impacts from weather and heavy holiday promotions in certain categories, CEO Robert Niblock told CNBC. Considering those factors, it made sense for the company to reaffirm its prior financial outlook, he added.Management also said on a call with analysts and investors that it expects some incremental hurricane-related sales in the fourth quarter.Looking at Lowes in isolation, this is a good report today, Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Brian Nagel told CNBCs Squawk Box.The one negative, according to Nagel, would be rival Home Depot reporting even better same-store sales growth of 7.9 percent last week.Lowes also announced that Chief Operating Officer Rick Damron will retire and be replaced by the president of the companys international business, Richard Maltsbarger, effective Feb. 3.In his new role, Maltsbarger will lead Lowes push into creating more ways to reach customers whether they are buying online or in stores.In an attempt to lure younger shoppers, Lowes has been experimenting with technology and opened up smart home centers at some locations ahead of the holidays.Earlier this year, Lowes rolled out a virtual reality experience that offers do-it-yourself assistance through tutorials inside Lowes Holoroom. Then, in September, Lowes launched two new augmented reality apps — one for measuring an object, or distance, within the phones camera view, and one for viewing images of furnishings, at scale, within a users own home.We drove traffic in-store and online with compelling messaging, Niblock said in a statement Tuesday. He added the company continues to invest in these efforts.Lowes also said Tuesday it bought back $500 million in stock during the third quarter.Lowes shares have climbed a little more than 14 percent in 2017.
A Chat With GSI Commerce’s Rubin#Cramer recommended e-commerce company GSI Commerce as a Christmas play. Now that the stock is up 17% since then, the Mad Money maven is wondering if it’s time to take profits. He got Chairman, CEO and President Michael Rubin on the phone to figure it out.Rubin notes that GSI is barely eight years old – and e-commerce, for that matter, is only 10. For that reason, “There’s so much growth ahead of us,” he says. The CEO predicts comp-store sales will more than double the business over the next five years. Also, an increase in new partners, marketing services and internationalization are all contributing to the growth spurt. Cramer liked what he heard. He recommends holding on to the stock – and buying it if it dips below $20. Questions? Comments?
Pros Say: Bond Market Rally Is Ending#What is the best trade on Treasurys? Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak, and George Goncalves, head of U.S. interest rates strategy in the Americas at Nomura Securities, shared their insights.Were coming toward the end of a bond market rally that has been in motion for over 30 years, Goncalves told CNBC.The question is, how long can rates stay low and does the Fed have the ability to keep them anchored?Goncalves said investors should lighten up on their bond holdings and wait for yields to pop.Greenhaus View:In the meantime, Greenhaus said now is not a good time to short bonds.We are shifting from the secular bull market in bonds into the next secular bear...and timing that shift will be very difficult, especially when you have every class of investor increasing their exposure to bonds, and Ben Bernanke with an unlimited paper machine coming in and buying what will be at least $1 to $2 trillion worth of additional Treasurys over the next couple of years.
January Barometer#Forget the thermometer, in January you should check the barometer. According to Gary Kaminsky January sets the tone for the entire year.The phenomenon is known as the January Barometer and it’s only been wrong 5 times since 1950.How does it work?Traditionally January is a month of inflows into equity funds, explains veteran trader Gary Kaminsky. That’s something you’ve got to watch. This year you would look at the flows and ask yourself, “Is this the best the equity market can do?”
Revolving Door at SEC Is Hurdle to Crisis Cleanup#A senior lawyer for the Securities and Exchange Commission recently took center stage in a major case involving a controversial mortgage security sold by Goldman Sachs.There was just one slight twist in the legal proceedings. The S.E.C. lawyer was not the prosecutor taking the deposition. He was the witness.This summer, Adam Glass — who joined the agency two years ago and is now co-chief counsel in charge of helping write the rules for the complex financial instruments known as derivatives — testified in a deposition about Goldman’s Abacus, a mortgage investment that the government argues was designed to fail.It turns out that Mr. Glass has a unique perspective on Wall Street exotica. Before working on the financial crisis cleanup, he helped create the opaque securities that contributed to the mess.
Self-driving trucks are here, but they won’t put truck drivers#Self-driving trucks are here. Otto, a self-driving  truck startup that Uber acquired this summer, shipped a truckload of  Anheuser-Busch beer across Colorado. According to  Ottos blog post on the trip,  our professional driver was out of the drivers seat for the  entire 120-mile journey down I-25, monitoring the self-driving  system from the sleeper berth in the back.  But this doesnt mean the nations truck drivers need to start  working on their résumés. Technology like this may  eventually displace human truck drivers, but the tech is several  years away from causing mass unemployment.  More from Timothy B. Lee:  This is Facebooks plan to fight  fake news  Interest rate hikes slow the economy. So why did the Fed  just announce one? Automationis inevitable. Heres how to make sure we create jobs, not justdestroy them. The key reason is that Ottos self-driving technology is  initially limited to highways. When the truck reaches ordinary  city streets, it hands control over to a human driver to handle  tricky traffic situations. This means that even after a truck is  outfitted with Ottos self-driving technology, it will still need  a human driver in the truck.
Bernanke Speech: Putting the Adults Back in Charge#The Bernanke speech: The consensus is often wrong, but this time they hit it pretty close to the mark. While stocks initially sold off, they have now made a modest comeback. For the first time in a while, theres no real gaming of the Fed, and many traders think that is a good thing. True equity bulls dont want people buying because of (quantitative easing)  in there with them... they want other true bulls and strong hands, one trader wrote to me. Bernanke did not make any new policy pronouncements, as expected. He did say that the meeting in September would be two days instead of one; that may give room for discussion of a larger range of policy responses. Bernanke reiterated that the Fed had a range of tools that could be used to provide additional monetary stimulus. He kicked the ball into the court of President Obama and the Congress: Most of the economic policies that support robust economic growth in the long run are outside the province of the central bank... In other words, hes telling the executive and legislative branches to do their job.European Central Bank President Trichet is also speaking in Jackson Hole Saturday, and Bernanke lobbed a little grenade in his direction as well: I have confidence that our European colleagues fully appreciate what is at stake in the difficult issues they are now confronting, and that, over time, they will take all necessary and appropriate steps to address those issues effectively and comprehensively.Some are expecting Trichet to signal a more dovish position on rates. _____________________________Bookmark CNBC Data Pages:_____________________________Want updates whenever a Trader Talk blog is filed?

Amazons PillPack is battling with CVS and Walgreens over getting#As Amazon bolsters its PillPack business to take on the prescription drug market, industry stalwarts CVS and Walgreens are vigorously defending their turf, setting up a protracted battle between the old guard and the new.Amazon bought internet pharmacy PillPack last year, a deal that sent shares of pharmacy companies tumbling. To get people onto its mail-delivery service, PillPack needs patients to switch from their existing pharmacy, which often means transferring prescriptions from CVS or Walgreens, the two largest chains in the U.S.But PillPack has run into a significant roadblock in getting those transfers approved. CVS and Walgreens are rejecting an increasing number of their requests, claiming that PillPack isnt getting proper consent from patients. PillPack says it always gets patient approval before making transfer requests and blames the pharmacy giants for unfairly refusing to honor them, sometimes hanging up on PillPacks pharmacists or throwing the request forms in the trash.While incumbent pharmacies may be disappointed in the loss of business, it is unacceptable to make unsubstantiated allegations about PillPacks practices while simultaneously creating systemic barriers that make it harder for a customer to switch pharmacies, PillPack spokeswoman Jacquelyn Miller told CNBC.The conflict has continued to escalate, with a source familiar with the matter telling CNBC that Amazon is documenting all cases of refused transfers. The incumbents are unwilling to roll over for Amazon in a market where a single customer, who often has chronic conditions and requires regular refills, can represent thousands of dollars of revenue a year through copayments and insurance coverage.
Ebola could reach France and UK by end of October:#Scientists have used Ebola disease spread patterns and airline  traffic data to predict a 75 percent chance the virus could be  imported to France by October 24, and a 50 percent chance it  could hit Britain by that date.   Those numbers are based on air traffic remaining at full  capacity. Assuming an 80 percent reduction in travel to reflect  that many airlines are halting flights to affected regions,  Frances risk is still 25 percent, and Britains is 15  percent.   Its really a lottery, said Derek Gatherer of Britains  Lancaster University, an expert in viruses who has been tracking  the epidemic - the worst Ebola outbreak in history. Read MoreEbola patient in Dallas fighting for his life says CDC head  The deadly epidemic has killed more than 3,400 people since it  began in West Africa in March and has now started to spread  faster, infecting almost 7,200 people so far. Nigeria, Senegal  and now the United States - where the first case was diagnosed on  Tuesday in a man who flew in from Liberia - have all seen people  carrying the Ebola haemorrhagic fever virus, apparently  unwittingly, arrive on their shores.
Heres a first look at Apples $549 AirPods Max headphones#Apple sent me a pair of its new AirPods Max headphones to check out ahead of their release on Dec. 15. The $549 price tag shocked a lot of people when Apple unveiled them earlier this week. And, yeah, thats a lot of money. But they sure are nice.Apple dominates the Bluetooth headphone business, with more than a 50% share of the market, according to Strategy Analytics. Thats thanks to the huge success of the original AirPods and AirPods Pro. With the AirPods Max, Apple built a luxury pair of headphones that borrows some of the features from the AirPods Pro but with larger speakers and more premium materials like steel and aluminum and better sound.The AirPods Max kind of remind me of the original HomePod. Its one of the best sounding smart speakers on the market, but it also costs several times more than competitors from Amazon and Google. Apple may not sell millions and millions of the AirPods Max the way it does the AirPods, but it doesnt need to. I think these are really just a top-tier option for people who want the best headphones Apple makes. Sort of like how Apple sells a $5,999 Mac Pro for people who want the best Mac Apple makes.Heres a look at the AirPods Max:
Whats Wrong With Simon Johnson?#Simon Johnson, the former chief economist of the IMF who is now a leading financial commentator at Baseline Scenario, is one of the more prominent critics of the view that blame for the financial crisis falls on affordable housing and fair lending policies. The problem is that his critique is extremely misguided.
D.C. drama could have detrimental impact on the market, some#As political uncertainty continues to mount, some strategists fear intensifying D.C. drama could further push out a tax reform package and roil markets. Following Mondays disclosure that two former Trump campaign officials were indicted as part of Special Counsel Robert Muellers investigation, continued political turmoil could have a potential long-term and very negative impact on capital markets, said strategist Boris Schlossberg. The critical question going forward is whether this is just a one-and-done, or whether its just the beginning of a very long and perhaps a very, very tedious judicial process that could really weigh both on Washington and Wall Street as we go forward, Schlossberg, managing director of foreign exchange strategy at BK Asset Management, said Monday on CNBCs Trading Nation. These questions come as economic data have been superb, Schlossberg said. Specifically, he pointed to the latest consumer spending data, which reflected the largest monthly gain since 2009 (likely affected by spending related to recent hurricane devastation), and personal income, which also rose month-over-month. Still, markets are very concerned, because the big catalyst going forward is tax reform. Thats what the market is looking for as the next jump-start to get the economy going to the next level, he said.Should the administrations agenda stall further, that could weigh very badly on the market, he said. According to a Bloomberg News report on Monday, Republicans are considering gradually lowering the corporate tax rate, and markets had a relatively muted response. Furthermore, the market is also ripe for some kind of pullback, Schlossberg said, which gives him an overall cautious view heading into the rest of the year. Others are less concerned about the probability that Muellers investigation into Russian attempts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election could weigh meaningfully on equities. There is some trepidation on the Mueller indictments but we are starting to see Trump as teflon, so much so that we think he can get away with firing Mueller and markets would actually take that well as it would remove an overhang. Cries for impeachment remain far fetched whether we like that emotionally or not, Michael Block, chief strategist at Rhino Trading Partners, wrote Monday in a note to clients. Block added: And the crazy thing is, if Trump does fire Mueller, its probably bullish for stocks. It would show that this guy can do anything he wants including shove pro business legislation down everyones throat. Im not happy about this kind of power even if I like whats good for stocks, but thats my honest read. U.S. markets closed lower on Monday.
Top Ten Cosmetic Surgeries 2011#Maybe people need a distraction from the bleak economic headlines of the day, or maybe its Americas obsession with youth. Either way, business is booming in the business of nips, tucks, and lifts. Cosmetic plastic surgery procedures rose two percent to 1.6 million in 2010, according to a recent study by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS), which represents 7,000 board-certified plastic surgeons. Consumers are willing to spend on themselves again and confidence is up, says Dr. Phil Haeck, president of the ASPS. Although 91 percent of all cosmetic procedures were performed on women, statistics show that more men are going under the knife. Overall cosmetic plastic surgery procedures for men were 2 percent higher in 2010 than the previous year. The men out there are worrying about how they look compared to the competition, which is much younger, says Haeck. So what are Americans looking to improve?

US created 211,000 jobs in April, vs 185,000 jobs expected#Job creation in April bounced back from a disappointing March, with nonfarm payrolls growing by 211,000 while the unemployment rate fell to 4.4 percent, its lowest since May 2007.Economists surveyed by Reuters had been expecting payroll growth of 185,000 and the headline jobless rate to tick up one-tenth to 4.6 percent. The payroll increase nearly tripled the dismal March number.Market experts believe the report likely cements an imminent interest rate hike.The market has sorely needed a shot of unambiguously positive hard data, Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial, said in a statement. This mornings employment report suggests the Fed will most certainly move in June.Wages grew seven cents an hour to an annualized pace of 2.5 percent.The unemployment rate dropped even as the labor force participation rate edged lower to 62.9 percent. The employment-to-population ratio increased to 60.2 percent, its best showing of 2017 and the highest level since February 2009.This just adds to the perception that its going to be easier and easier to find a job if you want one these days, said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings. Its job security that causes people to ask for wage rises. If its easier for them to get a job outside their company, theyre more likely to push for higher wages.An alternative reading on the unemployment rate that includes those not actively looking for jobs as well as those working part-time for economic reasons dropped to 8.6 percent from 8.9 percent in March, the best reading since November 2007. Those counted as not in the labor force swelled to 94.4 million but that was countered by an increase of 156,000 counted as employed, according to the household survey.
Amazon gives shoppers a glimpse at its Prime Day deals#Amazon has finally  lifted the lid on its second-annual Prime Day sale, which its  touting as the biggest Amazon event ever.  On July 12, the online retailer will offer Prime members new  deals as often as every five minutes. That compares with a new  deal every 10 minutes during last years Prime Day. In all, the  sale will include more than 100,000 deals spanning nearly all  departments and categories, from televisions to vitamins. Amazon  did not provide a comparable number of items for last years  event, but said this is the largest number of deals its offered  in a single day.  The U.S. sale will kick off at 3 a.m. Eastern for existing Prime  members, as well as those who sign up that day for one of its  paid memberships or free 30-day trial. Unlike last year, Amazon  will offer a handful deals for Prime members in the week leading  up to Prime Day, on items including a 32-inch TV bundled with a  Fire TV Stick, which will sell for $119.99.   Following last years record sales, we have dramatically  increased the inventory behind many deals, said Greg Greeley,  vice president of Amazon Prime. That includes nearly double the  number of TV units in stock as compared with Black Friday and  Cyber Monday combined. Last year, some shoppers  complained on social media that the deals were selling out too  quickly.  Amazons Prime Day playbook is similar to its Black Friday  strategy, which also rolled out deals every five minutes. Company  spokeswoman Julie Law said some of the discounts will be deeper than  last years event.  During its inaugural Prime Day sale, held last July in honor of  the companys 20th anniversary, Amazon sold more units than on  Black Friday 2014, which at the time was its biggest ever  (Amazons 2015 Black Friday event surpassed that metric). In  addition to driving sales, the event led to more new members  trying Prime than on any day in its history, Amazon said.  Though Amazon does not release information regarding the number  of Prime members, Consumer Intelligence Research Partners  estimates Amazon has 54 million U.S. members. The firms data also  shows that 73 percent of Amazons 30-day trial subscribers pay for  the first full year of membership. And 91 percent of first-year  subscribers renew for a second year, CIRP said.  Amazon has not set an explicit goal for this years event, though the company expects it to be another record-breaking  Prime Day, Law said. She said additional details regarding specific Prime  Day deals will be released closer to the event, including far  more limited-time lightning deals and deals of the day. Shoppers last year also grumbled on social media that the discounts were not as deep as they had expected, and that some of the items on sale seemed strange. One deal, for example, promoted a chefs hat.  Law responded to criticism that the Prime Day discounts at times  seem random, saying the event is different from Black Friday in  that its not a gifting holiday. Instead, its the time of year  when shoppers are stocking up on such things as seasonal summer  goods and back-to-school essentials, she said.  What could be weird to one person may be wonderful to someone  else, Law said. We really stand behind the deals we had last  year and the deals we have this year.  Amazons announcement, while widely expected, comes one day after  Wal-Mart announced  a free 30-day trial  for its ShippingPass service, which is positioned as a  competitor to Prime. Similar to Amazon Prime, Wal-Mart shoppers  can pay an annual fee to receive unlimited two-day  shipping.   Wal-Marts version of the service costs $49 a year, compared to  $99 for an annual Prime subscription. However, Prime membership  includes additional benefits that arent part of Wal-Marts  program, including unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows.  Amazon also boasts a broader array of products, with more than 20  million items eligible for Prime. Walmarts U.S. site has roughly  7 million items up for grabs.
Stocks waver on a big earnings day#NEW YORK -- A weak showing in home sales and a mixed batch of earnings reports kept the stock market flipping between minor gains and losses on Wall Street. With an hour left in the trading day, the major market indexes were slightly up.A strong profit report from Procter & Gamble helped indexes start higher early Thursday, but they weakened in late morning trading after a realtor group said that the pace of contracts for new home sales had leveled off.That turned the stocks of builders sharply lower.

They overlooked shrinking economies in Europe, slower growth in China and other signs that this earnings season would be rough. In the past two weeks, theyve paid for it.We had a party and now were dealing with a hangover, he said. The market is basically back to where it was at the end of August.

Busch: Official Wrong Thing At the Wrong Time#"It seems there is a global effort to exacerbate the problems
    and worries of the world. Lets start in Japan where Prime
    Minister Taro Aso said today that people should not be
    over-concerned about daily movements in Japanese share prices,
    after the benchmark Nikkei average fell to a 5-year low.Stock prices in New York fell yesterday, but they rose the
    day before. We should not fret over stock moves, Aso told
    reporters according to MNI. Which begs the question, whens the
    next election in Japan? Im thinking they are closer to Italy
    than we know....BTW, Japanese exports to the US fell 10% and
    Japans trade surplus shrunk 94% as a wonderful indication of
    why stocks in Japan are under pressure.Next up fresh after being forced to testify on Capitol Hill,
    the ratings agencies are out and about focusing on emerging
    markets. Standard & Poors Ratings Services today said
    it had revised its outlook on the long-term sovereign credit
    ratings on The Russian Federation to negative from stable
    according to Reuters. The outlook revision reflects the
    likelihood of a downgrade if costs to the Russian government of
    the bank rescue operations continue to increase, amid rising
    capital outflows as confidence in the financial system and the
    monetary regime declines, Standard & Poors credit
    analyst Frank Gill said. It is difficult at present to
    determine the ultimate impact on the public sector balance
    sheet of the banking system bail-out, not least due to the
    uncertain outlook on asset quality. How about looking at lower
    oil prices as an indication of their problems along with that
    little foray into a neighboring country? Just for fun, put up a
    chart of crude vs the Russian Ruble.Yesterday, United States Sen. Charles Schumer, Sen. Jack
    Reed, and Sen. Robert Menendez asked the US Treasury department
    to establish guidelines saying that banks receiving government
    capital injections should use the funds to restore their
    lending practices to levels prior to the onset of the credit
    crisis. Although we are supportive of your efforts to restore
    stability to the financial system through direct capital
    injections into financial institutions, we are concerned that
    if the program is not implemented correctly, its effectiveness
    will be limited. According to CNBCs website, the letter tells
    Treasury officials that they should issue guidelines that
    specify the type of lending allowed, encourage loan
    modifications, and provide more oversight of executive
    legislation. In this same vein, the Michigan congressional
    delegation has drafted a letter it intends to send to Federal
    Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry
    Paulson later this week, urging the two officials to use their
    broad regulatory authority to promote liquidity in the U.S.
    auto industry. (WSJ)This type of government micromanaging of the financial
    system and government reach into the private sector takes us
    full circle back to the 1930s. This will accelerate with a
    potentially strongly Democratic legislative and executive
    branches next year. Globally, the theme of governments
    aggressively stepping into the private sector is the short term
    cure for all that ails from credit crisis. Longer term for the
    developed countries, it will create sclerotic economies unable
    to grow faster than 2% due to regulation and programs designed
    to effect social goals instead of profit targets. For now, all
    that matters is survival and socialism is embraced. ________________________"

The Problem With Waiting for a Pullback#Investors waiting for a cheaper stock market entry point risk  missing out, Simon Baker of Baker Avenue Asset Management said  Monday.  Heres the problem if youre waiting for that pullback: The move  back comes back so, so quickly, he said.  On CNBCs Fast Money, Baker said  that at a recent Miami conference of high net-worth investors,  about half were waiting for such a dip to buy.  The question, he added, was simple: Where do you want to be in  the market?  Cyclical sectors would likely lead the market higher, and it was  time to get out defensive positions, Baker said.  Id go long the ETF in technology and short the staples. Its a  good hedge, he said. Its a pair trade, but I think you need to  be long.  TheStreet CIO Stephanie Link also said that cyclicals were  undervalued.  Links top picks included Eaton,  Stanley Black & Decker and  Ensco.  I think that the global economic story has changed because you  have more liquidity measures being implemented, she said.

Prepare for an Oil Shock With Currencies#There is a lot of tough talk emanating from the Middle East. Heres a currency-trading plan in case the situation worsens.With all the news about oil output and rumors of possible military action in the Middle East, its a good idea to have a trading plan in the event of an oil shock. Rebecca Patterson, chief markets strategist for J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Institutional, is looking north for her plan. If you are trading currencies and you see a headline go across the tape saying something has happened, whats the first thing you should do? If its a supply shock, I want to go with a current account surplus country. I want to be long the Norwegian krone, she told CNBCs Melissa Lee.To keep the trade liquid, Patterson suggests using the euro  as a cross. Also, because we dont know what levels well be at if and when this happens, she says, were just going to use where we are now as an example.So for now, Patterson suggests entering the trade right around 7.6200, with a stop at 7.4000 and a target of 7.7000. Todd Gordon, co-head of research and trading at Aspen Trading Group, says the trade measures up nicely in technical terms. And Patterson adds that its not just the oil issue that could make this trade work.
Cash-Hungry States Are Putting Buildings on the Block#Is it better to rent or to own?The default answer for a long time — when real estate’s horizon seemed limitless — was to own.

Since 2009 every time stocks have 3-week losing streak, the#Stocks began the truncated trading week after Memorial Day on a negative note.

Here are some ways to play the stay-at-home theme using#With millions working and learning from home, some exchange-traded fund issuers are trying to capitalize on the shift to virtual living.Direxion kicked it off in April by announcing it would file for a work-from-home ETF, ticker WFH, tracking industries at the heart of remote connectivity such as cybersecurity, communications and cloud technologies.Whether others will follow Direxions lead remains to be seen, but there are already numerous options on the ETF market that investors can use to play the stay-at-home boom, market analysts say.Its amazing how weve been talking about FANG stocks for so long, but they worked right into the whole stay-at-home world – online shopping, home offices, video streaming, ... modern communication, Tom Lydon, the CEO of ETF Trends and ETF Database, told CNBCs ETF Edge on Monday.All four FANG companies — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet — reported their first-quarter earnings results within the last two weeks. Shareholders responded well to all but Amazon, which said it would spend the entirety of its second-quarter profits on bolstering its coronavirus response. Netflixs spike in new subscribers was a particular highlight.One of the most popular ways to trade these names using ETFs is via the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), which tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index, Lydon said.The FANG stocks make up 35% of QQQ. If you add in Microsoft, its 47%, he said. So, its a great way to play it as we continue to be quarantined in this stay-at-home world because it doesnt seem that their businesses are going to get weak any time soon. They just continue to pull away from the pack.ETFs that have the biggest position in the FAANG stocks — which is FANG plus Apple — include the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLC) at more than 47%, the Vanguard Communication Services ETF (VOX) at over 44% and the Fidelity MSCI Communication Services Index ETF (FCOM), also at 44%.Other existing products investors could consider include some of Global Xs more focused products, Todd Rosenbluth, senior director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA Research, said in the same ETF Edge interview.He highlighted the Global X Cloud Computing ETF (CLOU) and the Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ).Cloud computing [and] robotics ... [are] themes that I think have been driven home as people need more bandwidth to be able to work from home and as companies realize that they need more of an automation and use robotics when they can to improve the supply chain, Rosenbluth said. Some of these themes are really going to resonate with investors even more in 2020 than they have in the recent past, he said. And theres a whole host of these products from First Trust, from ROBO, from other firms that are really in this space for investors that want to dig deeper into how you can play this stay-at-home theme.Jason Bloom, director of global macro ETF strategy at Invesco, suggested Invesco probably wont be getting as granular as some others in the ETF industry anytime soon.We do try to be responsive, clearly, to changes in the structure of the market or fundamentals that would suggest that you have an investment theme that makes sense, he said in the same ETF Edge interview.Were probably a little more conservative in that durability of the theme for us is ... a very high priority, Bloom said. So, if theres a risk that the theme may only have a year or two or so before it runs its course, its probably not going to make it through our process, but if we think it has five, 10 years or more of durability then it certainly makes sense to us.Disclosure: Invesco is the sponsor for CNBCs ETF Edge.Disclaimer
